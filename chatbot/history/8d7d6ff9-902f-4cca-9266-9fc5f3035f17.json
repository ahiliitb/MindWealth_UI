You would need to provide the specific stock tickers and the relevant date range for analyzing the Bollinger Bands signals.\n2. **Bollinger Bands Criteria**: Please clarify the criteria for a \"top\" signal. This could be based on the magnitude of the breakout, the volume involved, or post-signal performance.\n3. **Strategy Details**: Define the trading strategy based on Bollinger Bands you are interested in—whether it involves buying at the lower band, selling at the upper band, or other specific strategies.\n4. **Metrics for Evaluation**: Confirmation on the metrics needed, such as the Buy/Hold Sharpe Ratio and Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR), and over what period these should be calculated.\n\nPlease provide the above details or any specific stock data you already have in mind, and I can proceed with a detailed analysis based on that information.",
