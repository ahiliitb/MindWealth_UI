ALWAYS use proper Markdown formatting\n2. ALWAYS include spaces between words and punctuation\n3. Use bullet points (- or •) for lists\n4. Use **bold** for emphasis\n5. Use headers (##, ###) to organize sections\n6. Use line breaks between paragraphs\n7. Format numbers with proper spacing: \"245.27 is significantly above the track level (169.28)\"\n8. NEVER concatenate words without spaces\n\nWhen analyzing data:\n1. Be precise and data-driven in your analysis\n2. Highlight key trends and patterns\n3. Provide actionable insights when possible\n4. Use technical analysis terminology appropriately\n5. Consider the time period and context of the data\n6. Structure your response with clear sections and proper spacing\n\nCRITICAL DATA ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS:\n🚨 FINANCIAL DATA INTEGRITY IS CRITICAL 🚨\n\n**When Data IS Provided:**\n1. The user query will include sections like \"=== DATA CONTEXT ===\" or \"=== ENTRY SIGNALS (JSON) ===\" with actual data\n2. If you see JSON data with fields like \"signal_type\", \"record_count\", \"data\", etc., then DATA HAS BEEN PROVIDED\n3. Extract and analyze information EXACTLY as it appears in the provided JSON/data\n4. Use the exact function names, symbols, dates, and prices from the data field\n5. Provide thorough analysis based on the data provided\n\n**When Data IS NOT Provided:**\n1. If you see ONLY a user question without any \"=== DATA CONTEXT ===\" sections, then NO data has been provided\n2. State clearly: \"No data has been provided. Please provide the dataset to analyze.\"\n3. NEVER invent, fabricate, or hallucinate function names, symbols, dates, prices, or any metrics\n\n**NEVER DO THIS (Hallucination):**\n- Make up function names like \"HIGH VOLTAGE\", \"RADAR SWEEP\" that don't exist in the provided data\n- Invent signal dates or prices not in the data\n- Create fake symbols or tickers\n- Fabricate performance metrics or CAGR values\n\n**ALWAYS DO THIS (Accurate):**\n- Check if \"=== DATA CONTEXT ===\" or similar sections exist in the message\n- If data exists, extract information from the \"data\" field in the JSON\n- If data doesn't exist, clearly state that no data was provided\n- Use EXACT values from the provided data fields\n\nCRITICAL: Always format your response in clean, readable Markdown with proper spacing.\nBase your responses STRICTLY on actual data provided in the message context.\n",

      "content": "# Top 5 Signals by Backtested Sharpe Ratio\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of your trading signals, here are the **top 5 signals ranked by Backtested Strategy Sharpe Ratio**:\n\n---\n\n## 🥇 **1. FRACTAL TRACK - AAPL (Apple Inc.) - Long**\n- **Signal Date/Price:** January 12, 2026 at $260.25\n- **Backtested Strategy Sharpe Ratio:** **18.72** ⭐\n- **Sharpe Ratio of Buy and Hold:** 0.65\n- **Win Rate:** 100.0% over Past 5 years (13 trades)\n- **Backtested Strategy CAGR:** 27.85%\n- **Current Performance:** 0.0%, 0 days\n\n**Analysis:** This is an exceptional signal with an extraordinarily high Sharpe ratio of 18.72, indicating outstanding risk-adjusted returns. The strategy has achieved a perfect 100% win rate over 13 trades in the past 5 years, with a strong CAGR of 27.85%. This significantly outperforms the buy-and-hold Sharpe ratio of 0.65, demonstrating the FRACTAL TRACK function's effectiveness in timing AAPL entries.\n\n---\n\n## 🥈 **2.

Despite having only 4 trades over 6 years, the strategy maintains a perfect win rate and delivers a solid 23.54% CAGR. The current position is slightly underwater at -2.56%, but the historical performance suggests strong potential for recovery.\n\n---\n\n## 🥉 **3. FRACTAL TRACK - XLU (Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund) - Long**\n- **Signal Date/Price:** January 25, 2026 at $42.56\n- **Backtested Strategy Sharpe Ratio:** **3.45**\n- **Sharpe Ratio of Buy and Hold:** 0.14\n- **Win Rate:** 100.0% over Past 20 years (19 trades)\n- **Backtested Strategy CAGR:** 10.1%\n- **Current Performance:** 1.47%, 2 days\n\n**Analysis:** This utilities sector signal demonstrates exceptional consistency with a perfect 100% win rate over an impressive 20-year backtest period with 19 trades.

DELTADRIFT - AAPL (Apple Inc.) - Long**\n- **Signal Date/Price:** January 12, 2026 at $260.25\n- **Backtested Strategy Sharpe Ratio:** **3.24**\n- **Sharpe Ratio of Buy and Hold:** 0.43\n- **Win Rate:** 100.0% over Past 4 years (7 trades)\n- **Backtested Strategy CAGR:** 13.49%\n- **Current Performance:** 0.0%, 0 days\n\n**Analysis:** A second high-performing AAPL signal, this time from the DELTADRIFT function. With a Sharpe ratio of 3.24 and a perfect 100% win rate over 7 trades, this signal complements the FRACTAL TRACK signal on the same stock. The CAGR of 13.49% is solid, though lower than the FRACTAL TRACK variant.\n\n---\n\n## 5️⃣ **5. FRACTAL TRACK - CSCO (Cisco Systems) - Long**\n- **Signal Date/Price:** January 14, 2026 at $74.41\n- **Backtested Strategy Sharpe Ratio:** **3.15**\n- **Sharpe Ratio of Buy and Hold:** 0.44\n- **Win Rate:** 100.0% over Past 5 years (13 trades)\n- **Backtested Strategy CAGR:** 22.72%\n- **Backtested Strategy CAGR:** 22.72%\n- **Current Performance:** 1.13%, 1 day\n\n**Analysis:** This CSCO signal rounds out the top 5 with a Sharpe ratio of 3.15 and an impressive 22.72% CAGR. The strategy has maintained a perfect 100% win rate over 13 trades in the past 5 years and is currently profitable at +1.13% after just one day.\n\n---\n\n## 📊 **Key Insights:**\n\n1. **FRACTAL TRACK Dominance:** 4 out of 5 top signals use the FRACTAL TRACK function, suggesting this strategy excels at identifying optimal entry points with superior risk-adjusted returns.\n\n2. **Perfect Win Rates:** All top 5 signals maintain 100% win rates in their backtested periods, indicating highly reliable strategies.\n\n3. **Sharpe Ratio Excellence:** The top signal (AAPL FRACTAL TRACK) has an exceptional Sharpe ratio of 18.72, which is extraordinarily rare and indicates minimal volatility relative to returns.\n\n4. **Diversification:** The top 5 includes technology (AAPL, CSCO, UBER) and utilities (XLU), providing sector diversification.\n\n5. **Current Performance:** Most signals are either flat or slightly positive, with only UBER showing a small drawdown of -2.56%.\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ **Risk Considerations:**\n\n- While historical Sharpe ratios are exceptional, past performance doesn't guarantee future results\n- The AAPL FRACTAL TRACK signal's Sharpe ratio of 18.72 is unusually high and may not be sustainable\n- Monitor position sizing carefully, especially for signals with limited trade history (like UBER with only 4 trades)\n- Consider the current market environment and any fundamental changes since signal generation",
