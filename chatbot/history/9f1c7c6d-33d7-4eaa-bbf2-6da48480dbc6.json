      "content": "To provide a comprehensive analysis of trading signals for New Zealand companies, I would need specific data or a list of companies and their stock tickers. However, I can guide you on how to analyze trading signals for New Zealand stocks using common technical indicators and methods:\n\n1. **Identify Key Companies**: Focus on major companies listed on the New Zealand Exchange (NZX), such as Fletcher Building Limited (FBU), Auckland International Airport Limited (AIA), and Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited (FPH).\n\n2. **Technical Indicators**: Use common technical indicators to generate trading signals:\n   - **Moving Averages (MA)**: Look for crossovers between short-term and long-term moving averages (e.g., 50-day MA crossing above the 200-day MA for a bullish signal).\n   - **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: Identify overbought or oversold conditions (RSI above 70 indicates overbought, below 30 indicates oversold).\n   - **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**: Look for signal line crossovers and divergence from price trends.\n   - **Bollinger Bands**: Observe price movements outside the bands for potential reversal signals.\n\n3. **Historical Data Analysis**: Review historical price data to identify patterns such as support and resistance levels, trend lines, and chart patterns (e.g., head and shoulders, double tops/bottoms).\n\n4. **Volume Analysis**: Analyze trading volume to confirm trends and signals. High volume on a breakout can indicate a strong trend.\n\n5. **Market Context**: Consider macroeconomic factors, such as interest rates, GDP growth, and geopolitical events, which can impact stock performance.\n\nIf you have specific data or companies in mind, please provide more details, and I can offer a more tailored analysis.",
