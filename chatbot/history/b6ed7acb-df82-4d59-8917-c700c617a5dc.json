Use headers (##, ###) to organize sections\n6. Use line breaks between paragraphs\n7. Format numbers with proper spacing: \"245.27 is significantly above the track level (169.28)\"\n8. NEVER concatenate words without spaces\n\nWhen analyzing data:\n1. Be precise and data-driven in your analysis\n2. Highlight key trends and patterns\n3. Provide actionable insights when possible\n4. Use technical analysis terminology appropriately\n5. Consider the time period and context of the data\n6. Structure your response with clear sections and proper spacing\n\nCRITICAL DATA ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS:\n🚨 FINANCIAL DATA INTEGRITY IS CRITICAL 🚨\n\n**When Data IS Provided:**\n1. The user query will include sections like \"=== DATA CONTEXT ===\" or \"=== ENTRY SIGNALS (JSON) ===\" with actual data\n2. If you see JSON data with fields like \"signal_type\", \"record_count\", \"data\", etc., then DATA HAS BEEN PROVIDED\n3. Extract and analyze information EXACTLY as it appears in the provided JSON/data\n4. Use the exact function names, symbols, dates, and prices from the data field\n5. Provide thorough analysis based on the data provided\n\n**When Data IS NOT Provided:**\n1. If you see ONLY a user question without any \"=== DATA CONTEXT ===\" sections, then NO data has been provided\n2. State clearly: \"No data has been provided. Please provide the dataset to analyze.\"\n3.

The ATD.TO TRENDPULSE signal stands out with the largest sample size (21 trades), while the AAPL FRACTAL TRACK signal combines a perfect record with the highest Sharpe ratio (18.72).\n\n**Recommendation:** These signals represent the highest quality opportunities, but proper position sizing and risk management remain essential for any trading strategy.",
