Here are the top five signals with the highest Sharpe Ratios:\n\n1. **IBIT**\n   - Signal: Long\n   - Signal Date: 2025-10-02\n   - Exit Signal Date: 2025-10-10\n   - Sharpe Ratio: 1.78\n\n2. **DOL.TO (Dollarama Inc.)**\n   - Signal: Long\n   - Signal Date: 2025-08-19\n   - Exit Signal Date: 2025-10-10\n   - Sharpe Ratio: 1.08\n\n3. **BYD.TO (Boyd Group Services Inc.)**\n   - Signal: Long\n   - Signal Date: 2025-09-14\n   - Exit Signal Date: 2025-10-10\n   - Sharpe Ratio: 0.99\n\n4. **HOOD (Robinhood Markets, Inc.)**\n   - Signal: Long\n   - Signal Date: 2025-09-30\n   - Exit Signal Date: 2025-10-10\n   - Sharpe Ratio: 0.97\n\n5. **BTC-USD (Bitcoin)**\n   - Signal: Long\n   - Signal Date: 2025-10-02\n   - Exit Signal Date: 2025-10-07\n   - Sharpe Ratio: 0.91\n\nThese signals have demonstrated a high Sharpe Ratio, indicating a favorable risk-adjusted return. A higher Sharpe Ratio suggests that the asset has provided better returns per unit of risk taken. However, it's important to consider other factors such as market conditions and individual asset performance when making trading decisions.",
