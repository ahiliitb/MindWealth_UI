As of October 10, 2025, the price has risen to $245.27, marking a gain of 5.91% over 39 days. Here are the key points from the data:\n\n1. **Signal Type and Confirmation**: The signal is a long position, confirmed on August 15, 2025. This suggests a bullish outlook from the TRENDPULSE analysis.\n\n2. **Performance**: Since the signal date, AAPL has appreciated by 5.91%. This is consistent with the backtested average return of 11.8% for winning trades, indicating a positive performance relative to historical data.\n\n3. **Win Rate and Historical Context**: The strategy has a high win rate of 87.5% over the past 10 years, based on 8 trades. This suggests a robust historical performance for similar signals.\n\n4. **Backtested Metrics**:\n   - **Best/Worst/Average Returns**: The backtested returns for winning trades show a best return of 18.76%, a worst return of 0.65%, and an average return of 11.8%.\n   - **Max Drawdown**: The strategy experienced a max drawdown of 26.3%, which is a significant risk factor to consider.\n   - **Sharpe Ratio**: The backtested strategy Sharpe Ratio is 1.20, compared to a buy-and-hold Sharpe Ratio of 0.83, indicating a better risk-adjusted return for the strategy.\n\n5. **Targets and Support Levels**:\n   - **Targets**: The historical rise or fall to pivot targets are set at various levels, with the highest being $309.0801.\n   - **Support Levels**: Recent extrema and horizontal support levels are noted, with the lowest being $119.0319.\n\n6. **Comparative Performance**: The strategy's CAGR is 10.27%, while the buy-and-hold CAGR is 22.37%, resulting in a negative difference of -12.1%. This suggests that while the strategy has been profitable, it underperforms compared to a simple buy-and-hold approach over the same period.\n\nOverall, the TRENDPULSE signal for AAPL has been profitable in the short term, with a strong historical win rate and favorable risk-adjusted returns. However, the strategy's CAGR underperforms compared to a buy-and-hold strategy, which should be considered when making investment decisions.",
