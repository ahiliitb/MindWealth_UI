Explain which horizon should dominate and why.\n\nBottom Line (Verdict)\n\nBased on verified reports and each function’s historical holding periods, state whether JPM is a Buy, Hold, or Sell for:\n\nShort term\n\nMedium term\n\nConstraints\n\nUse only signals you can see and verify in the Streamlit app.\n\nDo not invent or infer signals beyond what’s documented.\n\nApply the exit-date filter I provided (entries may precede it).\n\nOne-liner version:\n“Deep-dive JPM using all Streamlit functions/reports within my exit-date window; list verified signals with hold-period context, flag direction/exit/time-horizon conflicts, and conclude Buy/Hold/Sell for short- and medium-term—no invented signals.\n\n=== COLUMN SELECTION BY SIGNAL TYPE ===\n\nENTRY:\n  Columns: Function, Symbol, Signal, Signal Date/Price[$], Exit Signal Date/Price[$], Current Trading Date/Price[$], Current Price vs Signal, Targets (Historic Rise or Fall to Pivot/Avg % Gain of Historic Winning trades/Exit Rule/Horizontal/F-Stack 1/F-Stack 2) [$], Interval, Backtested Holding Period(Win Trades) (days) (Max./Min./Avg.), SignalType\n  Reasoning: For entry signals, we need comprehensive details including function name, direction, entry/exit timestamps & prices, target/stop levels, and historical holding periods to analyze JPM's signals across all functions.\n\nEXIT:\n  Columns: Function, Symbol, Signal, Signal Date/Price[$], Exit Signal Date/Price[$], Current Trading Date/Price[$], Current Price vs Signal, Targets (Historic Rise or Fall to Pivot/Avg % Gain of Historic Winning trades/Exit Rule/Horizontal/F-Stack 1/F-Stack 2) [$], Interval, Backtested Holding Period(Win Trades) (days) (Max./Min./Avg.), SignalType\n  Reasoning: For exit signals, we need to verify completed trades with exit timestamps & prices, target/stop levels, and historical holding periods to ensure consistency and analyze conflicts in JPM's signals.\n\n=== DATA CONTEXT ===\n\n=== ENTRY SIGNALS (JSON) ===\n{\n  \"signal_type\": \"entry\",\n  \"record_count\": 2,\n  \"columns_selected\": [\n    \"Function\",\n    \"Symbol, Signal, Signal Date/Price[$]\",\n    \"Exit Signal Date/Price[$]\",\n    \"Current Trading Date/Price[$], Current Price vs Signal\",\n    \"Targets (Historic Rise or Fall to Pivot/Avg % Gain of Historic Winning trades/Exit Rule/Horizontal/F-Stack 1/F-Stack 2) [$]\",\n    \"Interval\",\n    \"Backtested Holding Period(Win Trades) (days) (Max./Min./Avg.)\",\n    \"SignalType\"\n  ],\n  \"reasoning\": \"For entry signals, we need comprehensive details including function name, direction, entry/exit timestamps & prices, target/stop levels, and historical holding periods to analyze JPM's signals across all functions.\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"Function\": \"TRENDPULSE\",\n      \"Symbol, Signal, Signal Date/Price[$]\": \"JPM, Long, 2025-10-31 (Price: 311.12)\",\n      \"Exit Signal Date/Price[$]\": \"No Exit Yet\",\n      \"Interval, Confirmation Status\": \"Daily, is CONFIRMED on 2025-10-31\",\n      \"Current Trading Date/Price[$], Current Price vs Signal\": \"2025-10-31 (Price: 311.12), 0.0% below\",\n      \"Backtested Holding Period(Win Trades) (days) (Max./Min./Avg.)\": \"51 days/4 days/15 days\",\n      \"Targets (Historic Rise or Fall to Pivot/Avg % Gain of Historic Winning trades/Exit Rule/Horizontal/F-Stack 1/F-Stack 2) [$]\": \"320.6092/324.187/314.46/No Horizontal Resistance/357.3035/404.0796\",\n      \"SignalType\": \"entry\",\n      \"_signal_type\": \"entry\",\n      \"_asset\": \"JPM\",\n      \"_function\": \"TRENDPULSE\",\n      \"_date\": \"2025-10-31\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Function\": \"OSCILLATOR DELTA\",\n      \"Symbol, Signal, Signal Date/Price[$]\": \"JPM, Long, 2025-10-31 (Price: 311.12)\",\n      \"Exit Signal Date/Price[$]\": \"No Exit Yet\",\n      \"Interval, Confirmation Status\": \"Daily, is Confirmed on 2025-10-31\",\n      \"Current Trading Date/Price[$], Current Price vs Signal\": \"2025-11-03 (Price: 309.35), 0.57% below\",\n      \"Backtested Holding Period(Win Trades) (days) (Max./Min./Avg.)\": \"25 days/2 days/12 days\",\n      \"Targets (Historic Rise or Fall to Pivot/Avg % Gain of Historic Winning trades/Exit Rule/Horizontal/F-Stack 1/F-Stack 2) [$]\": \"324.7159/335.6051/326.68/No Horizontal Resistance/328.9175/381.492\",\n      \"SignalType\": \"entry\",\n      \"_signal_type\": \"entry\",\n      \"_asset\": \"JPM\",\n      \"_function\": \"OSCILLATOR DELTA\",\n      \"_date\": \"2025-10-31\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n=== IMPORTANT: SIGNAL TABLE DISPLAY ===\nAt the end of your response, you MUST provide the exact 4-key identifiers for ONLY the specific signals you want to appear in the data table. \n\nFor each signal you specifically mention or analyze in your response, provide:\n\nSIGNAL_KEYS: [\n  {\"function\": \"EXACT_FUNCTION_NAME\", \"symbol\": \"SYMBOL\", \"interval\": \"Daily\", \"signal_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\"},\n  ...\n]\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n1. Only include signals you specifically mention in your analysis (e.g., if you say \"top 5\", provide exactly 5 keys)\n2. Use EXACT values from the data: Function name, Symbol (first part of \"Symbol, Signal, Signal Date/Price[$]\"), and actual signal date\n3. The table will show ONLY these signals - not all processed data\n4. Always use \"Daily\" for interval unless data shows otherwise\n\nExample: If you mention \"AAPL has the highest Sharpe ratio\" and \"MSFT shows strong CAGR\", provide:\nSIGNAL_KEYS: [\n  {\"function\": \"FRACTAL TRACK\", \"symbol\": \"AAPL\", \"interval\": \"Daily\", \"signal_date\": \"2025-10-16\"},\n  {\"function\": \"BAND MATRIX\", \"symbol\": \"MSFT\", \"interval\": \"Daily\", \"signal_date\": \"2025-10-15\"}\n]\n",

The maximum holding period for TRENDPULSE is also significantly longer (51 days versus 25 days).\n\n- **Targets:** The longer-term potential targets for TRENDPULSE (357.3035/404.0796) are higher compared to OSCILLATOR DELTA (328.9175/381.492), indicating a stronger bullish outlook.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- **TRENDPULSE** is better suited for a long-term position due to its longer holding period and higher long-term target levels. This suggests a potentially more sustained bullish trend, making it more favorable for a long-term investment strategy.",
