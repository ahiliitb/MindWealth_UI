      "content": "The FRACTAL TRACK signal for AAPL indicates a long position initiated on October 10, 2025, at a price of $245.27. As of the same date, there is no exit signal yet, and the current mark-to-market is 0.0% since the signal is newly initiated.\n\nKey insights from the data:\n- The signal has a high historical win rate of 87.5% based on backtesting over the past 44 years with 8 trades analyzed on a quarterly interval.\n- The signal will be confirmed as valid at the end of the current quarter, and it will be canceled if the price falls below $169.21 before December 31, 2025.\n- The track level price is $169.2862, which is 44.88% below the current price, indicating a significant buffer before the signal would be invalidated.\n- The backtested returns for winning trades show a best return of 3369.7%, a worst return of 144.18%, and an average return of 1288.28%.\n- The backtested strategy has a Sharpe Ratio of 0.42, which is lower than the buy and hold strategy's Sharpe Ratio of 0.55.\n- The strategy's CAGR is 15.43%, compared to a buy and hold CAGR of 17.35%, resulting in a negative difference of -1.92%.\n\nOverall, the FRACTAL TRACK signal for AAPL suggests a potential long-term upward trend, but it is still in the early stages and requires confirmation by the end of the quarter. The historical performance shows substantial potential returns, although the strategy's Sharpe Ratio is lower than that of a buy and hold approach.",
