      "content": "To determine which fractal track signals are still on the \"right side\" of the reference retracement level, we need to compare the current price against the track level/price specified in the fractal track signal. Here is the analysis based on the provided data:\n\n1. **AAPL**\n   - **Signal Type**: Long\n   - **Signal Date/Price**: 2025-10-10 at $245.27\n   - **Current Trading Date/Price**: 2025-10-10 at $245.27\n   - **Track Level/Price**: Not explicitly provided in the data, but the current price is at the signal price.\n   - **Status**: The current price is exactly at the signal price, indicating it is neither above nor below the reference retracement level. More information on the track level is needed for a precise determination.\n\n2. **ASML**\n   - **Signal Type**: Long\n   - **Signal Date/Price**: 2025-10-10 at $936.19\n   - **Current Trading Date/Price**: 2025-10-10 at $936.19\n   - **Track Level/Price**: Not explicitly provided in the data, but the current price is at the signal price.\n   - **Status**: The current price is exactly at the signal price, indicating it is neither above nor below the reference retracement level. More information on the track level is needed for a precise determination.\n\n3. **ATM.NZ**\n   - **Signal Type**: Long\n   - **Signal Date/Price**: 2025-10-10 at $10.21\n   - **Current Trading Date/Price**: 2025-10-10 at $10.21\n   - **Track Level/Price**: Not explicitly provided in the data, but the current price is at the signal price.\n   - **Status**: The current price is exactly at the signal price, indicating it is neither above nor below the reference retracement level. More information on the track level is needed for a precise determination.\n\n4. **BAC**\n   - **Signal Type**: Long\n   - **Signal Date/Price**: 2025-10-10 at $48.65\n   - **Current Trading Date/Price**: 2025-10-10 at $48.65\n   - **Track Level/Price**: Not explicitly provided in the data, but the current price is at the signal price.\n   - **Status**: The current price is exactly at the signal price, indicating it is neither above nor below the reference retracement level. More information on the track level is needed for a precise determination.\n\n5. **BRK-B**\n   - **Signal Type**: Long\n   - **Signal Date/Price**: 2025-10-06 at $500.02\n   - **Current Trading Date/Price**: 2025-10-10 at $489.13\n   - **Track Level/Price**: Not explicitly provided in the data, but the current price is below the signal price.\n   - **Status**: The current price is 2.18% below the signal price, indicating it is below the reference retracement level.\n\nIn summary, without explicit track levels provided in the data, we can only determine that BRK-B is below its signal price, suggesting it is not on the right side of the reference retracement level for a long signal. For the other tickers, additional information on the track levels is needed to make a precise determination.",
