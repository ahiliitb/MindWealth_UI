However, I can guide you on how to calculate and interpret the Sharpe Ratio for trading signals if you have historical data.\n\n### Calculating the Sharpe Ratio:\n1. **Determine the Expected Return**: Calculate the average return of the trading signal over a specific period.\n2. **Risk-Free Rate**: Use a risk-free rate, such as the yield on a 10-year government bond, for the same period.\n3. **Calculate the Standard Deviation**: Determine the standard deviation of the trading signal's returns to measure volatility.\n4. **Sharpe Ratio Formula**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sharpe Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Average Return} - \\text{Risk-Free Rate}}{\\text{Standard Deviation of Return}}\n   \\]\n\n### Interpreting the Sharpe Ratio:\n- **Higher Sharpe Ratio**: Indicates better risk-adjusted returns.\n- **Comparison**: Use it to compare different trading signals or strategies to identify which offers the best return for the level of risk taken.\n\n### Steps to Identify Top Signals:\n1. **Collect Data**: Gather historical returns for each trading signal.\n2. **Calculate Sharpe Ratios**: For each signal, calculate the Sharpe Ratio using the formula above.\n3. **Rank Signals**: Rank the signals based on their Sharpe Ratios from highest to lowest.\n4. **Select Top Signals**: Choose the top five signals with the highest Sharpe Ratios.\n\nIf you have specific historical data for TrendPulse or any other trading signals, I can help you analyze it further.",
