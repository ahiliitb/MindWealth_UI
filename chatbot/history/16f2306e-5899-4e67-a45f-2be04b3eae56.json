The data provided includes various assets with different trading signals and historical performance metrics.\n\n### Assets with Potential Achievement\n\nBelow are the assets that have shown potential achievement based on the F-Track 2 targets:\n\n- **AAPL**\n  - **F-Track 2 Support Level**: 294.82\n  - **Current Price**: 245.27\n  - **Analysis**: The current price is below the F-Track 2 support level, indicating no potential achievement at this level.\n\n- **AMD**\n  - **F-Track 2 Support Level**: Not explicitly mentioned\n  - **Current Price**: 214.9\n  - **Analysis**: The asset has achieved over 90% of the gain for F-Stack 1, but F-Track 2 is not explicitly mentioned.\n\n- **AMZN**\n  - **F-Track 2 Support Level**: 213.1321\n  - **Current Price**: 216.37\n  - **Analysis**: The current price is above the F-Track 2 level, indicating potential achievement.\n\n- **ARM**\n  - **F-Track 2 Support Level**: Not explicitly mentioned\n  - **Current Price**: 154.81\n  - **Analysis**: The asset has achieved over 90% of the gain for Avg % Gain of Historic Winning trades, but F-Track 2 is not explicitly mentioned.\n\n- **BDGI.TO**\n  - **F-Track 2 Support Level**: Not explicitly mentioned\n  - **Current Price**: 65.01\n  - **Analysis**: The asset has achieved over 90% of the gain for the Exit Rule, but F-Track 2 is not explicitly mentioned.\n\n- **BNS.TO**\n  - **F-Track 2 Support Level**: Not explicitly mentioned\n  - **Current Price**: 88.84\n  - **Analysis**: The asset has achieved over 90% of the gain for F-Stack 1, but F-Track 2 is not explicitly mentioned.\n\n- **BRK-B**\n  - **F-Track 2 Support Level**: Not explicitly mentioned\n  - **Current Price**: 489.13\n  - **Analysis**: The asset has achieved over 90% of the gain for the Exit Rule, but F-Track 2 is not explicitly mentioned.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- **AMZN** is the only asset where the current price is above the F-Track 2 level, indicating a potential achievement.\n- For other assets, while there are significant gains, the F-Track 2 level is not explicitly mentioned or achieved.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n- **AMZN**: Consider monitoring for further upward movement or potential exit strategies.\n- **Other Assets**: Continue monitoring for any changes in price that may align with F-Track 2 levels or other significant targets.",
