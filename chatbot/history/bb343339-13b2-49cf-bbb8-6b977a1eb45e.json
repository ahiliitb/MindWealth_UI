The data includes both the signals where an exit date has not yet been specified and those where exits have been recorded. Here is a detailed breakdown of the top signals.\n\n## Top 5 Entry Signals with No Exit Yet\nThese are the entry signals where the trade is still open, meaning no exit has been recorded yet.

This ratio is essential for understanding the risk-adjusted return of an investment and would typically be calculated using the strategy's return over its standard deviation, adjusted for the risk-free rate.\n\nUnfortunately, without specific return and volatility data over a given time period for these strategies, I cannot calculate or provide the Sharpe Ratios directly. If you can provide or specify access to the relevant performance data for these trading strategies, I can assist in calculating the Sharpe Ratios accordingly.
