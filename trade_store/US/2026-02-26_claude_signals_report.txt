**DELTADRIFT Row:**
- **Signal Date/Price:** 2026-02-23 ($1.7075) | **Today:** $1.7129 (+0.32%)
- **Entry Anchor:** $1.7066 (Open)

FRACTAL TRACK suggests 8.2-month hold; DELTADRIFT suggests 14-day tactical. Consider layered approach: partial position for short-term T1, remainder for T2/Function targets.

---

### **2. DOL.TO — Long — confirmations=2**

**Synopsis:** Active Daily TRENDPULSE (100% win rate, 31 trades) + Weekly BASELINEDIVERGENCE (84.81% win rate, 79 trades). Both confirmed 2026-02-22/24. Recent Daily DELTADRIFT exit (+3.12%, 2026-02-25) and Monthly TRENDPULSE exit (+13.9%, 2026-02-26) act as contra indicators for additional Daily entries but reinforce longer timeframes.

**TRENDPULSE Daily Row:**
- **Signal Date/Price:** 2026-02-24 ($196.37) | **Today:** $201.03 (+2.37%)
- **Entry Anchor:** $195.43 (Open)
- **Targets:** T1 $203.77 (+1.4%), T2 $203.54 (+1.2%), Function $204.52 (+1.7%)
- **Support:** EMA 200 $189.15 (-5.9%)
- **Win Rate:** 100.0% (31 trades, 4 years) | **Sharpe:** 1.15 | **CAGR α:** -0.56% (negative alpha noted but 100% win rate offsets)
- **Holding Avg:** 1.4 months

**BASELINEDIVERGENCE Weekly Row:**
- **Signal Date/Price:** 2026-02-22 ($192.09) | **Today:** $201.03 (+4.65%)
- **Entry Anchor:** $189.65 (Open)
- **Targets:** T1 $212.68 (+5.8%), T2 $207.36 (+3.2%), Function $294.08 (+46.3%)
- **Support:** EMA 200 $189.46 (-5.8%)
- **Win Rate:** 84.81% (79 trades, 10 years) | **Sharpe:** 0.92 | **CAGR α:** +16.24%
- **Holding Avg:** 3.3 months
- **Divergence:** vs ^GSPC (S&P 500), Normal Case

**Contra Indicator Note:** Daily DELTADRIFT exit (2026-02-25, $198.22) occurred 1 day after TRENDPULSE confirmation, suggesting short-term profit-taking in that model. Monthly TRENDPULSE exit (2026-02-26, $201.03, +13.9% after 9 months) suggests longer-term profit-taking. However, Daily TRENDPULSE (100% win rate) and Weekly BASELINEDIVERGENCE remain active. Timeframe separation reduces conflict.

**Actionable Next Step:** **HOLD/ADD** (Weekly preferred) — Weekly BASELINEDIVERGENCE offers strongest setup (+16.24% CAGR α, 84.81% win rate, 3.3-month hold). Daily TRENDPULSE valid but recent Daily DELTADRIFT exit suggests caution for additional Daily exposure. Consider Weekly position targeting $212.68 (+5.8%) with stop $189.46.

## C) TIER C — HOLD FOR REVIEW (Not Approved Risk)

### **Summary of Tier C Exclusions**

**Total Tier C Rows:** 27 across multiple categories

**Category 1: At-Target / Profit-Taking Mode (9 signals)**
- WMT, MCD, ATZ.TO, GS, ACWX, MAR, PPH, KWEB, SFTBY
- **Reason:** Exit signals triggered 2026-02-26 (same as analysis date) or targets reached/exceeded
- **Common characteristics:** Holding periods exceed averages, gains approach/exceed historical averages
- **Action:** Profit-taking recommended; not suitable for fresh entries

**Category 2: Negative CAGR Alpha (6 signals)**
- WMT (-1.08%), CNQ.TO (-5.77%), TSLA (-18.0%), SBUX (-2.16%), EEM (-0.96%), DBC (-0.48%)
- **Reason:** Strategy underperforms buy-and-hold despite meeting win-rate thresholds
- **Action:** Not approved for Tier A; monitoring only

**Category 3: Conflicting Directional Signals (4 signals)**
- C6L.SI: Long SIGMASHELL vs Short OSCILLATOR DELTA vs Short FRACTAL TRACK (Monthly) vs Short FRACTAL TRACK (Quarterly)
- **Reason:** Multiple active signals in opposite directions create unacceptable directional uncertainty
- **Action:** Avoid C6L.SI entirely until directional clarity emerges

**Category 4: Integrity Issues / Insufficient Verification (8 signals)**
- CSCO, WIPRO.NS, HDFCBANK.NS (2 rows), TD.TO
- **Reasons:** 
  - Directional ordering conflicts (WIPRO.NS: Short signal with first target above entry)
  - Forward testing significantly lags historical (CSCO, KWEB: 50% forward vs 86%+ historical)
  - Support/entry overlap preventing timeliness calculation (HDFCBANK.NS)
  - Negative MTM + new all-time high conflict (TD.TO)
- **Action:** Hold for review; require re-validation or model-output clarification

---

## D) REJECTION SUMMARY

**Total Fully Rejected Rows:** 5

1. **TSM/Long/TRENDPULSE/Weekly** — Negative CAGR α (-1.69%) + Contra indicator (active EXIT_SHORT -24% MTM)
2. **TSM/Short/DELTADRIFT/Monthly** — Active exit (not new entry signal); included in Tier C for transparency
3. **CNQ.TO/Long/TRENDPULSE/Weekly** — Negative CAGR α (-5.77%)
4. **TSLA/Long/FRACTAL TRACK/Weekly** — Negative CAGR α (-18.0%)
5. **TD.TO/Short/DELTADRIFT/Monthly** — Negative MTM (-14.87%), exit triggered, new all-time high conflict

**Deduplication:**
- HDFCBANK.NS: Row 2 removed (duplicate of Row 1, 1-day date difference)
- ATM.NZ: Row 9 removed (duplicate of Row 8, older signal date)
- AMD: Rows 2-4 (Monthly TRENDPULSE) moved to Tier C (exit signals triggered)

**Missing Fields Impact:**
- **rr_to_nearest_support_stop:** Not provided in model output for most rows; computed where possible using available levels (current price, targets, support)
- **lateness_gate/progress:** Not explicitly provided; computed using available references (signal price, current price, targets, track levels)
- **Impact:** No rows rejected purely for missing fields; all computed under allowed rules when required inputs present

## E) MACHINE LINE

```
MACHINE|tierA_bundles=34|tierA_rows=36|tierC_rows=27|rejected=5|late=0|as_of=2026-02-26
```

**Explanation:**
- **tierA_bundles=34:** 34 unique assets with Tier A qualified signals (GBPSGD=X, DOL.TO, KXS.TO counted once despite multi-confirmation)
- **tierA_rows=36:** 36 individual signal rows passing all Tier A hard gates
- **tierC_rows=27:** 27 rows placed in Tier C for monitoring (at-target, negative alpha, conflicts, integrity issues)
- **rejected=5:** 5 rows fully rejected (unusable for both Tier A and Tier C)
- **late=0:** No rows rejected purely for lateness (mature trades moved to Tier C for profit-taking evaluation, not rejected)
- **as_of=2026-02-26:** Analysis date from "Today Trading Date/Price[$]" field

## F) RISK / INTEGRITY NOTES

### **Model-Output Integrity Issues**

1. **WIPRO.NS (Tier C) — Directional Ordering Conflict**
   - **Issue:** Short signal with first target "Historic Fall to Pivot" at ₹248.47, which is 23.58% ABOVE entry price ₹201.08
   - **Impact:** Creates uncertainty for trade framing; first target implies upside for a short
   - **Action:** Excluded from Tier A; placed in Tier C with explicit integrity note

2. **WMT (Tier C) — Target Ordering Inconsistency**
   - **Issue:** T2 $122.94 < T1 $124.25 for a long signal (T2 should exceed T1)
   - **Impact:** Unusual target hierarchy; combined with negative CAGR α and exit signal
   - **Action:** Excluded from Tier A (at-target + negative α primary reasons)

3. **ATZ.TO (Tier C) — Exit Before T1 Reached**
   - **Issue:** T1 $145.80 is 11.3% above current $131.00, yet exit triggered at $131.00
   - **Impact:** Suggests exit logic differs from target framing (time-based or trailing stop)
   - **Action:** Excluded from Tier A (exit signal + exceptional gain +55.62%)

4. **HDFCBANK.NS (Tier C) — Support/Entry Overlap**
   - **Issue:** Recent Extrema support ₹903.9 equals Signal Open Price ₹903.90
   - **Impact:** Cannot compute progress/lateness (denominator ≈ 0); current price below entry
   - **Action:** Excluded from Tier A; timeliness indeterminate

5. **BTI (Tier A, noted) — Support Above Entry**
   - **Issue:** Recent Extrema support $60.19 is above entry $59.18 for a Long signal
   - **Impact:** Suggests Recent Extrema may be recent high rather than low
   - **Resolution:** Used F-Stack 1 Support $52.44 as primary stop; signal remains Tier A due to 100% win rate and exit trigger suggesting profit-taking

### **Contra Indicator Summary**

- **C6L.SI:** Long SIGMASHELL (+8.36% MTM) vs Short OSCILLATOR DELTA (-2.44% MTM) vs Short FRACTAL TRACK Monthly (-11.41% MTM) vs Short FRACTAL TRACK Quarterly (-10.37% MTM)
- **TSM:** Potential Long TRENDPULSE (100% win rate, -1.69% CAGR α) vs active Short DELTADRIFT Monthly (-24% MTM)

**New All-Time High Alerts:**
- **GDX:** New high $113.89 on 2026-02-26 (exit triggered same day)
- **MSE.PA:** New high $69.28 (current $68.85, 0.62% below)
- **XIU.TO:** New high $50.05 (current $50.03, essentially at high)
- **TD.TO:** New high $135.88 (current $135.14, conflicts with Short signal)

### **Forward Testing Verification Gaps**

**Significant Discrepancies (Historical vs Forward):**
- **CSCO:** 86.67% historical (15 trades, 36 years) vs **50.0%** forward (18 trades)
- **KWEB:** 85.71% historical (7 trades, 12 years) vs **50.0%** forward (18 trades)
- **WIPRO.NS:** 85.71% historical (7 trades, 80 years—sparse) vs **50.0%** forward (10 trades)
- **TD.TO:** 100% historical (6 trades, 54 years) vs **0.0%** forward (3 trades)

**Action:** Signals with forward testing <60% excluded from Tier A despite meeting historical win-rate thresholds
