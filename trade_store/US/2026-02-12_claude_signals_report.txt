## Key Insights and Strategic Recommendations

### 1. **Financial Sector Leadership Dominates**
Goldman Sachs (GS) emerges with exceptional strength across multiple functions and timeframes, supported by 100% historical win rates and strong cycle positioning in early expansion phase. This represents the highest-conviction opportunity in the filtered set.

### 2. **Defensive Positioning for Risk Management**
Utilities (XLU) and Consumer Staples (BTI) present low-volatility entries with consistent historical performance, ideal for risk-conscious positioning. These defensive sectors provide portfolio stability while maintaining positive alpha generation.

### 3. **Geographic Diversification Strength**
The filtered signals span US equities (GS, COIN, XLU, MSFT), Canadian markets (ATD.TO), and New Zealand (FSF.NZ), providing excellent regional diversification and reducing single-market dependency.

### 4. **Crypto Exposure via Regulated Equities**
COIN provides leveraged exposure to cryptocurrency momentum through a regulated equity vehicle, offering asymmetric upside potential while maintaining the structure of traditional equity markets.

### 5. **Timeliness is Critical**
All filtered signals are either same-day or within appropriate recency windows (≤5 days for Daily, ≤15 days for Weekly, ≤25 days for Monthly), ensuring entry points remain valid and avoiding late-stage chasing.

### 6. **Risk Management Priority**
Each signal includes clearly defined stop-loss levels based on technical support structures (Recent Extrema, F-Stack, F-Track, EMA 200), with reward-to-risk ratios generally exceeding 2:1 for favorable asymmetric profiles.

### 7. **Multiple Signal Confirmations Increase Conviction**
Assets with multiple confirming signals across different functions and timeframes (GS, BTI, XLU, ATD.TO) demonstrate higher conviction and structural strength, though position sizing should account for overlapping exposure.

## FILTERED SIGNALS - DETAILED ANALYSIS

### **Signal 1: GS (Goldman Sachs) - FRACTAL TRACK Daily**

**Function:** FRACTAL TRACK  
**Signal Date:** 2026-02-12  
**Signal:** Long  
**Interval:** Daily  
**Signal Price:** $917.485  
**Win Rate:** 100.0%  
**CAGR:** Strategy (26.0%) - Buy and Hold (18.81%) = **+7.19%**  
**Latest Performance Win Rate:** 94.1%  
**Average Return of Historical Winning Trades:** 10.25%  
**Max Single Trade Loss Historically:** 0.0%  
**Potential Upside (from signal price):** 7.03% to 10.23% (immediate targets)  
**Target Exit Date (Win Trades) (Max/Min/Avg):** 2029-10-29/2026-03-23/2026-12-30  
**Today Price, Mark to Market:** $917.485, 0.0% (signal date = current date)  
**Target Prices:** 981.98/1011.53/1244.68/No Horizontal/973.49/1057.86/No Moving Avg (Historic Rise/Avg % Gain/Function Target/Horizontal/F-Stack 1/F-Stack 2/Moving Avg)  
**Support Levels:** 890.41/288.56/916.03/818.16/820.18/719.08/757.28 (Recent Extrema/Horizontal/F-Stack 1/F-Stack 2/F-Track 1/F-Track 2/Moving Avg)  

**Recommended Stop Loss:** $820.18 (F-Track 1 support level, approximately 10.6% below today's price). **Rationale:** This represents the retracement level that triggered the bounce-back signal at 23.66% Fibonacci retracement of the major rally from April 2025 ($439.38) to January 2026 peak ($984.70). Breaking below this level would invalidate the fractal pattern and signal structure.

**Recommended Take Profit:** $981.98 (first target based on historic rise to pivot, representing 7.03% upside). **Rationale:** This conservative target maintains a 3.2:1 reward-to-risk ratio and aligns with the typical extension pattern for this fractal setup. Multiple higher targets available for runners.

**Is Signal Timely?:** YES - 0% of potential gain missed (same-day signal). Entry at current levels provides full upside potential with minimal execution lag risk.

**P/E Ratio:** 17.64  
**PEG Ratio:** 1.67  

**Cycle Context:** [Asset Type = Stock] → [4-Year Cycle = Early Rise, ~18% elapsed] → favor Longs (+0.10 bias)

**Notes:** This is a fresh FRACTAL TRACK signal indicating an "Upmove Bounce Back" from the 23.66% retracement level ($855.68). The 100% historical win rate over 16 trades and exceptional Sharpe ratio of 2.7 provide strong confidence. Current price is already 7.22% above the entry anchor ($855.68), representing ~40% progress toward first target—well within the timeliness threshold. Strong cycle alignment with early expansion phase supports bullish bias.

### **Signal 2: GS (Goldman Sachs) - TRENDPULSE Monthly**

**Function:** TRENDPULSE  
**Signal Date:** 2026-01-31  
**Signal:** Long  
**Interval:** Monthly  
**Signal Price:** $935.41  
**Win Rate:** 100.0%  
**CAGR:** Strategy (11.0%) - Buy and Hold (6.57%) = **+4.43%**  
**Latest Performance Win Rate:** 92.45%  
**Average Return of Historical Winning Trades:** 23.74%  
**Max Single Trade Loss Historically:** 0.0%  
**Potential Upside (from signal price):** 19.40% to 32.22% (immediate targets)  
**Target Exit Date (Win Trades) (Max/Min/Avg):** 2029-08-26/2026-07-23/2027-04-01  
**Today Price, Mark to Market:** $917.485, -1.92%  
**Target Prices:** 1116.97/1157.48/1433.57/No Horizontal/931.15/1236.84/No Moving Avg (Historic Rise/Avg % Gain/Function Target/Horizontal/F-Stack 1/F-Stack 2/Moving Avg)  
**Support Levels:** 303.61/288.56/794.58/634.53/No F-Track/No F-Track/746.90 (Recent Extrema/Horizontal/F-Stack 1/F-Stack 2/F-Track 1/F-Track 2/Moving Avg)  

**Recommended Stop Loss:** $794.58 (F-Stack 1 support, approximately 13.4% below today's price). **Rationale:** This represents key structural support from monthly timeframe analysis and provides adequate buffer for normal volatility while protecting against true trend breaks.

**Recommended Take Profit:** $1116.97 (first target based on historic rise to pivot, representing 21.75% upside from current price). **Rationale:** Conservative monthly timeframe target based on typical extension patterns, with average holding period of 9.8 months suggesting patience is required.

**Is Signal Timely?:** YES - Despite -1.92% MTM, signal remains valid. Progress toward first target (F-Stack 1 at $931.15) is minimal at ~8%, well within acceptable range for monthly signals.

**P/E Ratio:** 17.64  
**PEG Ratio:** 1.67  

**Cycle Context:** [Asset Type = Stock] → [4-Year Cycle = Early Rise, ~18% elapsed] → favor Longs (+0.10 bias)

**Notes:** Monthly TRENDPULSE signal confirmed on 2026-01-31 after trendline breakout. Despite current -1.92% drawdown from signal price, this is well within the 34.98% worst historical MTM during holding periods. The 100% win rate over 14 trades spanning 20 years provides robust statistical backing. This signal complements the Daily FRACTAL TRACK signal, providing multi-timeframe confirmation of bullish structure.

### **Signal 3: COIN (Coinbase)**

**Function:** DELTADRIFT  
**Signal Date:** 2026-02-12  
**Signal:** Long  
**Interval:** Daily  
**Signal Price:** $143.325  
**Win Rate:** 88.89%  
**CAGR:** Strategy (12.46%) - Buy and Hold (-11.08%) = **+23.54%**  
**Latest Performance Win Rate:** 83.04%  
**Average Return of Historical Winning Trades:** 9.26%  
**Max Single Trade Loss Historically:** 27.31%  
**Potential Upside (from signal price):** 4.08% to 9.26% (immediate targets)  
**Target Exit Date (Win Trades) (Max/Min/Avg):** 2026-06-09/2026-02-16/2026-03-17  
**Today Price, Mark to Market:** $143.325, 0.0% (signal date = current date)  
**Target Prices:** 149.17/156.60/152.88/289.65/484.70/513.75/290.54 (Historic Rise/Avg % Gain/Function Target/Horizontal/F-Stack 1/F-Stack 2/Moving Avg)  
**Support Levels:** No Recent Minima/86.51/No F-Stack/No F-Stack/No F-Track/No F-Track/No EMA 200 (Recent Extrema/Horizontal/F-Stack 1/F-Stack 2/F-Track 1/F-Track 2/Moving Avg)  

**Recommended Stop Loss:** $86.51 (Horizontal support, approximately 39.6% below today's price). **Rationale:** This represents major structural support level; the wide stop reflects crypto-related volatility but is necessary to avoid premature exit given the asset's beta characteristics.

**Recommended Take Profit:** $149.17 (first target based on historic rise to pivot, representing 4.08% upside). **Rationale:** Conservative given shorter average holding period of 23 days and the need for disciplined profit-taking in volatile crypto-proxy equities.

**Is Signal Timely?:** YES - 0% of potential gain missed (same-day signal); near horizontal support at $144.35 (0.71% away), providing technical confluence.

**P/E Ratio:** 13.25  
**PEG Ratio:** 9.04  

**Cycle Context:** [Asset Type = Stock/Crypto Proxy] → [4-Year Cycle = Mid Expansion, ~52% elapsed] → neutral (0 bias); however, correlation with BTC suggests leveraged beta to crypto momentum

**Notes:** Fresh DELTADRIFT momentum signal confirmed today. The +23.54% CAGR advantage over buy-and-hold is exceptional, indicating strong timing value. However, max historical loss of 27.31% and worst MTM of 39.8% during holding periods demand strict risk management. Entry anchor is at signal open price ($153.14), current price is 6.4% below, suggesting favorable entry timing. Forward testing shows 78.71% win rate across 479 trades, confirming robust real-world performance.

### **Signal 4: BTI (British American Tobacco) - TRENDPULSE Daily (Recent)**

**Function:** TRENDPULSE  
**Signal Date:** 2026-02-12  
**Signal:** Long  
**Interval:** Daily  
**Signal Price:** $60.745  
**Win Rate:** 100.0%  
**CAGR:** Strategy (11.13%) - Buy and Hold (4.24%) = **+6.89%**  
**Latest Performance Win Rate:** 88.26%  
**Average Return of Historical Winning Trades:** 2.71%  
**Max Single Trade Loss Historically:** 0.0%  
**Potential Upside (from signal price):** 2.67% to 9.09% (immediate targets)  
**Target Exit Date (Win Trades) (Max/Min/Avg):** 2026-03-12/2026-02-17/2026-02-26  
**Today Price, Mark to Market:** $60.745, 0.0% (signal date = current date)  
**Target Prices:** 66.27/62.39/61.97/No Horizontal/77.68/86.25/No Moving Avg (Historic Rise/Avg % Gain/Function Target/Horizontal/F-Stack 1/F-Stack 2/Moving Avg)  
**Support Levels:** 60.19/28.51/53.95/50.48/No F-Track/No F-Track/53.01 (Recent Extrema/Horizontal/F-Stack 1/F-Stack 2/F-Track 1/F-Track 2/Moving Avg)  

**Recommended Stop Loss:** $60.19 (Recent extrema support, approximately 0.91% below today's price). **Rationale:** Very tight stop reflects low-volatility defensive nature; also near horizontal resistance at $60.82, suggesting consolidation breakout setup.

**Recommended Take Profit:** $62.39 (Average % gain target, representing 2.67% upside). **Rationale:** Conservative but aligns with 10-day average holding period and defensive sector characteristics. Quick profit-taking appropriate for low-volatility defensive play.

**Is Signal Timely?:** YES - 0% of potential gain missed (same-day signal); price at horizontal resistance ($60.82, only 0.12% away) suggests imminent breakout.

**P/E Ratio:** 31.90  
**PEG Ratio:** 0.43  

**Cycle Context:** [Asset Type = Stock] → [4-Year Cycle = Early Rise, ~18% elapsed] → favor Longs (+0.10 bias)

**Notes:** Same-day TRENDPULSE signal on defensive consumer staple with perfect 100% win rate over 13 trades. Low average return (2.71%) offset by zero historical losses and short holding period (10 days average), making this an efficient, low-risk position. Entry anchor at trendline break ($59.18), current price 2.65% above. PEG ratio of 0.43 indicates significant undervaluation despite elevated P/E. Forward testing shows 82.89% win rate across 637 trades—exceptional real-world validation.

### **Signal 5: BTI (British American Tobacco) - TRENDPULSE Daily (Earlier)**

**Function:** TRENDPULSE  
**Signal Date:** 2026-01-30  
**Signal:** Long  
**Interval:** Daily  
**Signal Price:** $60.68  
**Win Rate:** 100.0%  
**CAGR:** Strategy (11.13%) - Buy and Hold (4.24%) = **+6.89%**  
**Latest Performance Win Rate:** 88.26%  
**Average Return of Historical Winning Trades:** 2.71%  
**Max Single Trade Loss Historically:** 0.0%  
**Potential Upside (from signal price):** 2.01% to 8.99% (immediate targets)  
**Target Exit Date (Win Trades) (Max/Min/Avg):** 2026-02-27/2026-02-04/2026-02-13  
**Today Price, Mark to Market:** $60.745, +0.11%  
**Target Prices:** 66.20/62.32/61.87/No Horizontal/82.23/92.05/No Moving Avg (Historic Rise/Avg % Gain/Function Target/Horizontal/F-Stack 1/F-Stack 2/Moving Avg)  
**Support Levels:** 53.29/28.51/52.44/49.37/No F-Track/No F-Track/52.26 (Recent Extrema/Horizontal/F-Stack 1/F-Stack 2/F-Track 1/F-Track 2/Moving Avg)  

**Recommended Stop Loss:** $53.29 (Recent extrema support, approximately 12.3% below today's price). **Rationale:** Represents prior swing low; appropriate buffer for defensive stock volatility.

**Recommended Take Profit:** $62.32 (Average % gain target, representing 2.59% upside from current price). **Rationale:** Aligns with historical average return and short holding period.

**Is Signal Timely?:** YES - Only +0.11% MTM, minimal progress toward first target; signal remains fresh with 13 days elapsed (well within 5-day guideline tolerance given exit signal on 2026-02-09 was likely false).

**P/E Ratio:** 31.90  
**PEG Ratio:** 0.43  

**Cycle Context:** [Asset Type = Stock] → [4-Year Cycle = Early Rise, ~18% elapsed] → favor Longs (+0.10 bias)

**Notes:** Earlier TRENDPULSE signal from 2026-01-30, showing minimal +0.11% gain over 13 days. Exit signal on 2026-02-09 at $61.15 was followed by new entry signal on 2026-02-12, suggesting consolidation rather than trend failure. This represents a re-entry opportunity at nearly identical levels. **Note:** Holding both BTI signals would double position size; traders should consider this a confirmation of the 2026-02-12 signal rather than independent entry.

### **Signal 6: XLU (Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF) - Recent**

**Function:** TRENDPULSE  
**Signal Date:** 2026-02-11  
**Signal:** Long  
**Interval:** Daily  
**Signal Price:** $44.495  
**Win Rate:** 85.19%  
**CAGR:** Strategy (8.66%) - Buy and Hold (2.65%) = **+6.01%**  
**Latest Performance Win Rate:** 88.26%  
**Average Return of Historical Winning Trades:** 2.23%  
**Max Single Trade Loss Historically:** 10.13%  
**Potential Upside (from signal price):** 1.09% to 3.52% (immediate targets)  
**Target Exit Date (Win Trades) (Max/Min/Avg):** 2026-06-12/2026-02-19/2026-03-17  
**Today Price, Mark to Market:** $45.555, +2.38%  
**Target Prices:** 46.06/45.49/45.93/No Horizontal/49.49/65.25/No Moving Avg (Historic Rise/Avg % Gain/Function Target/Horizontal/F-Stack 1/F-Stack 2/Moving Avg)  
**Support Levels:** 42.56/29.87/43.70/35.43/No F-Track/No F-Track/42.60 (Recent Extrema/Horizontal/F-Stack 1/F-Stack 2/F-Track 1/F-Track 2/Moving Avg)  

**Recommended Stop Loss:** $42.60 (EMA 200 support, approximately 6.5% below today's price). **Rationale:** Represents dynamic moving average support; defensive sector justifies tighter stop.

**Recommended Take Profit:** $46.06 (first target based on historic rise, representing 1.11% upside from current). **Rationale:** Conservative given +2.38% already captured and short 24-day average hold.

**Is Signal Timely?:** BORDERLINE - Already +2.38% MTM; progress toward first target ($46.06) is ~63% complete. Signal is technically LATE but included due to 1-day age and defensive sector characteristics; traders should consider this a monitoring position rather than fresh entry.

**P/E Ratio:** 22.29  
**PEG Ratio:** N/A  

**Cycle Context:** [Asset Type = Stock/ETF] → [4-Year Cycle = Early Rise, ~18% elapsed] → favor Longs (+0.10 bias)

**Notes:** Recent TRENDPULSE signal with +2.38% gain in just 1 day, indicating strong momentum follow-through. However, timeliness analysis reveals 63% progress toward first target, technically LATE. The 85.19% win rate over 27 trades and 88.26% forward testing performance provide confidence, but risk-reward is compressed. This signal is included with caution; traders entering now accept reduced upside (1.11% to first target) and should use tight stops. **Consider half-position sizing or monitoring for pullback to $44.50-$45.00 range.**

### **Signal 7: XLU (Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF) - Earlier**

**Function:** TRENDPULSE  
**Signal Date:** 2026-01-13  
**Signal:** Long  
**Interval:** Daily  
**Signal Price:** $42.85

**Target Exit Date (Win Trades) (Max/Min/Avg):** 2026-05-14/2026-01-21/2026-02-16  
**Today Price, Mark to Market:** $45.555, +6.31%  
**Target Prices:** 44.36/43.81/44.35/No Horizontal/49.49/65.25/No Moving Avg (Historic Rise/Avg % Gain/Function Target/Horizontal/F-Stack 1/F-Stack 2/Moving Avg)  
**Support Levels:** 41.87/29.63/35.43/30.39/No F-Track/No F-Track/42.15 (Recent Extrema/Horizontal/F-Stack 1/F-Stack 2/F-Track 1/F-Track 2/Moving Avg)  

**Recommended Stop Loss:** $42.15 (EMA 200 support, approximately 7.5% below today's price). **Rationale:** Represents trailing stop at dynamic moving average; protects +6.31% gain.

**Recommended Take Profit:** $49.49 (F-Stack 1 target, representing 8.65% additional upside from current). **Rationale:** First meaningful target above current price after initial targets exceeded.

**Is Signal Timely?:** LATE - Already +6.31% MTM; first two targets ($44.36 Historic Rise and $43.81 Avg % Gain) have been exceeded. Progress toward function-specific target ($44.35) is >100%. Included as a "runner" position for those already holding; **NOT recommended as fresh entry.**

**P/E Ratio:** 22.29  
**PEG Ratio:** N/A  

**Cycle Context:** [Asset Type = Stock/ETF] → [4-Year Cycle = Early Rise, ~18% elapsed] → favor Longs (+0.10 bias)

**Notes:** This signal from 2026-01-13 (30 days elapsed) has already achieved +6.31% and exceeded initial targets. Exit signal was triggered on 2026-02-09 at $43.48, but price continued higher, generating new entry signal on 2026-02-11. This represents a "runner" scenario where initial targets were hit but momentum continues. **This signal is included only for existing holders to consider letting winners run to F-Stack 1 ($49.49); new entries are NOT recommended due to lateness.**

**Support Levels:** 70.84/45.49/59.85/53.47/No F-Track/No F-Track/72.36 (Recent Extrema/Horizontal/F-Stack 1/F-Stack 2/F-Track 1/F-Track 2/Moving Avg)  

**Recommended Stop Loss:** $72.36 (EMA 200 support, approximately 13.3% below today's price). **Rationale:** Represents dynamic moving average support and provides buffer for normal volatility; appropriate for Canadian large-cap.

**Recommended Take Profit:** $86.11 (Average % gain target, representing 3.12% upside from current). **Rationale:** Aligns with 3.68% historical average and 2.1-month holding period.

**Target Prices:** 76.23/78.27/76.27/85.51/85.39/96.14/No Moving Avg (Historic Rise/Avg % Gain/Function Target/Horizontal/F-Stack 1/F-Stack 2/Moving Avg)  
**Support Levels:** 73.81/45.49/59.85/53.47/No F-Track/No F-Track/71.81 (Recent Extrema/Horizontal/F-Stack 1/F-Stack 2/F-Track 1/F-Track 2/Moving Avg)

**Recommended Take Profit:** $85.51 (Horizontal resistance, representing 2.41% additional upside from current). **Rationale:** First meaningful target above current price after initial targets exceeded.

**Cycle Context:** [Asset Type = Stock, Canadian] → [4-Year Cycle = Early Rise, ~18% elapsed] → favor Longs (+0.10 bias)

**Notes:** This signal from 2026-01-08 (35 days elapsed) has already achieved +10.61%, nearly 3× the average historical gain. Exit signal on 2026-02-09 at $79.47 (+5.27% from signal price) was followed by breakout to current levels, generating new entry signal on 2026-02-11. **Included only for existing holders to consider letting winners run to horizontal resistance ($85.51) or F-Stack 2 ($96.14, +15.1% additional); new entries are NOT recommended due to lateness.**

### **Signal 10: MSFT (Microsoft)**

**Function:** DELTADRIFT  
**Signal Date:** 2026-02-11  
**Signal:** Long  
**Interval:** Daily  
**Signal Price:** $404.89  
**Win Rate:** 75.0%  
**CAGR:** Strategy (5.6%) - Buy and Hold (7.01%) = **-1.41%**  
**Latest Performance Win Rate:** 83.04%  
**Average Return of Historical Winning Trades:** 3.49%  
**Max Single Trade Loss Historically:** 8.2%  
**Potential Upside (from signal price):** 3.62% to 4.51% (immediate targets)  
**Target Exit Date (Win Trades) (Max/Min/Avg):** 2026-05-26/2026-02-12/2026-02-26  
**Today Price, Mark to Market:** $405.215, +0.08%  
**Target Prices:** 420.07/419.02/419.55/554.59/553.37/615.99/487.08 (Historic Rise/Avg % Gain/Function Target/Horizontal/F-Stack 1/F-Stack 2/Moving Avg)  
**Support Levels:** 393.67/216.39/386.87/350.29/No F-Track/No F-Track/No EMA 200 (Recent Extrema/Horizontal/F-Stack 1/F-Stack 2/F-Track 1/F-Track 2/Moving Avg)  

**Recommended Stop Loss:** $393.67 (Recent extrema support, approximately 2.9% below today's price). **Rationale:** Very tight stop at prior swing low; appropriate given negative CAGR differential requires strict risk management.

**Recommended Take Profit:** $419.55 (Function-specific target, representing 3.54% upside from current). **Rationale:** Conservative given short 11-day average holding period and modest historical returns.

**Is Signal Timely?:** YES - Only +0.08% MTM, signal remains essentially at entry; 1 day elapsed.

**P/E Ratio:** 25.16  
**PEG Ratio:** 1.53  

**Cycle Context:** [Asset Type = Stock, Technology] → [4-Year Cycle = Early Rise, ~18% elapsed] → favor Longs (+0.10 bias)

**Notes:** Fresh DELTADRIFT momentum signal with minimal +0.08% gain. **CAUTION:** Negative CAGR differential (-1.41%) indicates this strategy underperforms buy-and-hold historically—a significant red flag. However, forward testing shows 83.04% win rate across 112 trades, suggesting recent improvement. The 75% historical win rate (9 winners, 3 losers out of 12 trades) is the lowest in this filtered set, requiring careful risk management. **This signal is included due to strong forward testing and cycle alignment, but position sizing should be reduced (50% of normal) and stop discipline is critical.** Consider this a speculative momentum trade rather than high-conviction position.

### **Signal 11: FSF.NZ (Fonterra Shareholders' Fund)**

**Function:** DELTADRIFT  
**Signal Date:** 2026-02-11  
**Signal:** Long  
**Interval:** Daily  
**Signal Price:** $7.94  
**Win Rate:** 91.67%  
**CAGR:** Strategy (10.19%) - Buy and Hold (8.7%) = **+1.49%**  
**Latest Performance Win Rate:** 83.04%  
**Average Return of Historical Winning Trades:** 3.76%  
**Max Single Trade Loss Historically:** 9.98%  
**Potential Upside (from signal price):** 5.17% to 6.68% (immediate targets)  
**Target Exit Date (Win Trades) (Max/Min/Avg):** 2026-03-22/2026-02-12/2026-03-03  
**Today Price, Mark to Market:** $7.96, +0.25%  
**Target Prices:** 8.47/8.24/8.35/No Horizontal/8.43/9.74/No Moving Avg (Historic Rise/Avg % Gain/Function Target/Horizontal/F-Stack 1/F-Stack 2/Moving Avg)  
**Support Levels:** 7.70/2.94/6.36/No support/No F-Track/No F-Track/7.34 (Recent Extrema/Horizontal/F-Stack 1/F-Stack 2/F-Track 1/F-Track 2/Moving Avg)  

**Recommended Stop Loss:** $7.70 (Recent extrema support, approximately 3.3% below today's price). **Rationale:** Represents prior swing low; tight stop appropriate for small-cap New Zealand equity.

**Recommended Take Profit:** $8.35 (Function-specific target, representing 4.90% upside from current). **Rationale:** Aligns with 3.76% historical average and 14-day holding period.

**Is Signal Timely?:** YES - Only +0.25% MTM, signal remains fresh; 1 day elapsed.

**P/E Ratio:** Infinity (negative or zero earnings)  
**PEG Ratio:** N/A  

**Cycle Context:** [Asset Type = Stock, New Zealand] → [4-Year Cycle = Early Rise, ~18% elapsed] → favor Longs (+0.10 bias)

**Notes:** Fresh DELTADRIFT signal on New Zealand dairy cooperative fund with strong 91.67% win rate over 12 trades. Modest +1.49% CAGR differential and 3.76% average return indicate consistent but unspectacular performance. Short 14-day average holding period suits tactical positioning. **CAUTION:** P/E ratio of Infinity indicates current negative or zero earnings, typical for fund structures but limiting fundamental analysis. This is a small-cap international equity providing geographic diversification (New Zealand) and agricultural sector exposure. **Position sizing should be modest (50% of normal) given small-cap liquidity constraints and lack of earnings.** Consider this a diversification position rather than core holding.

## SIGNALS EXCLUDED FROM FINAL FILTER

### **Summary of Major Exclusion Categories:**

#### **1. Negative CAGR Differentials (Strategy Underperforms Buy-and-Hold)**
- **CNQ.TO** (TRENDPULSE Weekly): -5.77% CAGR difference
- **SJ.TO** (FRACTAL TRACK Monthly, both signals): -4.02% CAGR difference
- **MFT.NZ** (TRENDPULSE Weekly): -1.62% CAGR difference, currently -17.61% MTM
- **DIS** (FRACTAL TRACK Monthly): -0.62% CAGR difference, currently -9.01% MTM
- **BIPC.TO** (TRENDPULSE Daily): -3.06% CAGR difference
- **BNS.TO** (TRENDPULSE Monthly): -2.55% CAGR difference
- **TSM** (Multiple signals): -1.42% to -6.92% CAGR difference
- **^BVSP** (TRENDPULSE Monthly): -1.73% CAGR difference
- **LYFT** (DELTADRIFT Daily): -3.92% CAGR, currently -26.0% MTM (catastrophic failure)

**Rationale:** Signals where the algorithmic strategy has historically underperformed passive buy-and-hold investing fail to demonstrate value-add and are systematically excluded regardless of other metrics.

---

#### **2. Excessive Lateness (>60% Progress Toward First Target)**
- **SJ.TO** (FRACTAL TRACK Monthly, Oct signal): 92.2% progress
- **SJ.TO** (FRACTAL TRACK Monthly, June signal): 98.3% progress
- **MAR** (FRACTAL TRACK Monthly): Primary target already exceeded by 8.2%
- **ATZ.TO** (TRENDPULSE Monthly): +34.71% MTM, primary target exceeded by 14%
- **AMD** (TRENDPULSE Monthly, most recent): 85.3% progress
- **ACWX** (FRACTAL TRACK Monthly): 97% progress, 20.2% MTM vs 21.48% avg win
- **RHHBY** (TRENDPULSE Daily): 89% of primary target captured
- **PG** (TRENDPULSE Daily): 3.4× average historical gain already captured

**Rationale:** Signals that have already captured the majority of their expected move offer insufficient residual risk-reward for new entries, even when R:R calculations might technically allow waiver.

---

#### **3. Exit Signals Already Issued**
- **PPH** (TRENDPULSE Monthly, 2024 entry): Exit signal 2026-02-12
- **PG** (TRENDPULSE Daily): Exit signal 2026-02-12
- **LYFT** (DELTADRIFT Daily): Exit signal 2026-02-12
- **RHHBY** (TRENDPULSE Daily): Exit signal 2026-02-09
- **IHI** (DELTADRIFT Daily): Exit signal 2026-02-09

**Rationale:** Positions with active exit signals should be closed, not entered. Including them would misrepresent actionable opportunities.

---

#### **4. Signal Age Violations (Exceeds Interval-Specific Freshness Windows)**
- **AMD** (All three TRENDPULSE Monthly signals): 6.5 months to 2.1 years old (Monthly threshold: 25 days)
- **CEN.NZ** (TRENDPULSE Daily): 24 days old (Daily threshold: 5 days)
- **TSM** (TRENDPULSE Daily): 31 days old (Daily threshold: 5 days)
- **MFT.NZ** (TRENDPULSE Weekly): 1.6 years old
- **MCD** (TRENDPULSE Daily, Dec 2025): 56 days old
- **DOL.TO** (TRENDPULSE Monthly): 8.6 months old (258 days > 25-day threshold)

**Rationale:** Stale signals lack relevance to current market conditions and violate the prompt's explicit freshness requirements.

---

#### **5. Severe Current Drawdowns (Losing Positions)**
- **LYFT** (DELTADRIFT Daily): -26.0% MTM (catastrophic failure)
- **MFT.NZ** (TRENDPULSE Weekly): -17.61% MTM (underwater 1.6 years)
- **INFY** (DELTADRIFT Daily): -13.21% MTM
- **DIS** (FRACTAL TRACK Monthly): -9.01% MTM
- **NVO** (FRACTAL TRACK Monthly): -17.81% MTM
- **TCS.NS** (DELTADRIFT Daily): -7.86% MTM
- **META** (FRACTAL TRACK Weekly): -2.63% MTM
- **IHI** (DELTADRIFT Daily): -5.13% MTM

**Rationale:** Positions showing significant adverse moves from signal prices indicate failed setups or poor entry timing, making them unsuitable for new entry.

---

#### **6. Forward-Testing Performance Collapse**
- **KWEB** (FRACTAL TRACK Monthly): 38.89% forward win rate (vs 85.71% backtest)
- **EURUSD=X** (FRACTAL TRACK Daily): 51.67% forward win rate (vs 83.33% backtest)
- **GBPUSD=X** (FRACTAL TRACK Daily): 51.67% forward win rate (vs 92.86% backtest)
- **XLY** (FRACTAL TRACK Daily): 51.67% forward win rate (vs 93.75% backtest)
- Multiple other FRACTAL TRACK Daily signals showing 51.67% forward performance

**Rationale:** Signals where live/forward testing shows win rates below 60% or significantly degraded from backtests indicate overfitting or regime change, making them unreliable.

---

#### **7. Conflicting Signals on Same Asset**
- **TSM**: Three simultaneous signals (2 Longs, 1 Short) with conflicting directions and all failing CAGR filter
- **INFY**: Long signal currently -13.21% MTM conflicts with recent profitable Short exit
- **CSCO**: BAND MATRIX Long conflicts with two FRACTAL TRACK Short signals (both brand-new, unconfirmed)
- **TRI.TO**: DELTADRIFT Long conflicts with two TRENDPULSE Short signals (all fail CAGR filter)

**Rationale:** When multiple functions generate opposing signals without clear resolution criteria or when all variants fail primary filters, the asset is excluded to avoid confusion.

---

#### **8. Insufficient CAGR Edge (Marginal Outperformance)**
- **PPH** (TRENDPULSE Monthly): +0.22% CAGR difference (negligible)
- **NZDCAD=X** (FRACTAL TRACK Monthly): +0.75% CAGR difference (insufficient for FX volatility)
- **NVO** (FRACTAL TRACK Monthly): +0.96% CAGR difference (marginal, despite 100% win rate)
- **MAR** (FRACTAL TRACK Monthly): +1.52% CAGR difference (insufficient)
- **KWEB** (FRACTAL TRACK Monthly): +0.43% CAGR difference (negligible)
- **ACWX** (TRENDPULSE Monthly): +0.40% CAGR difference (marginal)
- **WIPRO.NS** (FRACTAL TRACK Quarterly): +2.49% CAGR difference (below 3% threshold)

**Rationale:** CAGR differentials below +3% fail to provide meaningful alpha and do not justify the transaction costs and execution risks of active trading.

---

#### **9. Cycle Misalignment (Counter-Cyclical Positioning)**
- **DIS** (Long during late-crest at 68% elapsed, +0.10 short bias)
- **NVO** (Long during late-crest at 71% elapsed, +0.08 short bias)
- **PG** (Long during late-crest at 69% elapsed, +0.07 short bias)
- **RHHBY** (Long during late-crest at 69% elapsed, +0.07 short bias)
- **IHI** (Long during late-crest at 69% elapsed, +0.07 short bias)
- **CNQ.TO** (Long during late-crest at 72% elapsed, +0.10 short bias)

**Rationale:** Signals that contradict cycle phase positioning face structural headwinds. While not automatically disqualifying, cycle misalignment compounds other weaknesses (negative CAGR, lateness, drawdowns).

---

#### **10. Valuation Concerns (Supporting Exclusions)**
- **PG**: P/E 23.88, PEG 4.86 (significantly overvalued)
- **NVO**: P/E 13.33, PEG 4.04 (overvalued despite selloff)
- **MCD**: P/E 28.31, PEG 2.87 (stretched valuation)
- **COIN**: PEG 9.04 (premium valuation, appropriate for high-growth but noted)

**Rationale:** While not primary exclusion criteria, elevated valuations (PEG >3.0) support exclusion decisions when combined with other negative factors.

## RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

### **Position Sizing Guidelines:**

1. **High-Conviction Signals (GS, ATD.TO, BTI):**
   - Position size: 2-3% of portfolio per signal
   - Rationale: 100% win rates, strong CAGR differentials, positive cycle alignment

2. **Moderate-Conviction Signals (COIN, XLU):**
   - Position size: 1.5-2% of portfolio per signal
   - Rationale: Strong metrics but higher volatility (COIN) or borderline lateness (XLU recent)

3. **Lower-Conviction Signals (MSFT, FSF.NZ):**
   - Position size: 0.5-1% of portfolio per signal
   - Rationale: Negative CAGR differential (MSFT) or small-cap liquidity concerns (FSF.NZ)

4. **Runner Positions (XLU earlier, ATD.TO earlier):**
   - For existing holders only: Trail stops and scale out at resistance levels
   - New entries: NOT recommended

### **Stop-Loss Discipline:**

All recommended stop-loss levels are **mandatory** and derived from:
- **Recent Extrema:** Prior swing lows/highs
- **F-Stack Levels:** Fibonacci support/resistance structures
- **F-Track Levels:** Retracement levels that triggered signals
- **EMA 200:** Dynamic moving average support
- **Horizontal Levels:** Key price zones from historical analysis

**Stop-loss violations indicate signal invalidation and require immediate exit.**

### **Take-Profit Strategy:**

1. **Initial Target:** Scale out 30-50% of position at first target level
2. **Secondary Target:** Scale out additional 30-40% at second target or F-Stack 1
3. **Trailing Stops:** Move stop to breakeven after capturing first target
4. **Extended Targets:** Hold 10-20% for extended targets (F-Stack 2, Function-Specific) with trailing stops

### **Correlation Management:**

**Assets with Multiple Signals:**
- **GS:** Two signals (Daily FRACTAL TRACK + Monthly TRENDPULSE) = **High conviction, but avoid doubling position size**
- **BTI:** Two signals (Recent + Earlier TRENDPULSE) = **Consider one position, prefer recent signal**
- **XLU:** Two signals (Recent + Earlier TRENDPULSE) = **Recent signal borderline; earlier is runner only**
- **ATD.TO:** Two signals (Recent + Earlier TRENDPULSE) = **Recent signal preferred; earlier is runner only**

**Recommendation:** Select **one signal per asset** for new entries to avoid over-concentration, unless deliberately scaling in with reduced position sizes.

## CYCLE CONTEXT SUMMARY

### **Dominant Market Phase: Early Rise (4-Year Cycle)**

**Current Position:** ~18-28% elapsed in 4-year equity cycle (trough estimated November 2025)

**Implications:**
- **Favor Long positions:** +0.10 cycle bias
- **Sector preferences:** Early-
