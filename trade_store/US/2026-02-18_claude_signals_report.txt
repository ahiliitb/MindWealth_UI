# COMPREHENSIVE SIGNAL SYNTHESIS REPORT

**ANALYSIS_DATE: 2026-02-18**

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

After synthesizing 8 parallel processing results covering diverse asset classes, timeframes, and functions, **NO SIGNALS QUALIFY FOR TIER A APPROVED RISK** across the complete dataset. All signals face one or more hard-gate exclusions including:

- **At-target/profit-taking conditions** (signals already achieving substantial gains)
- **Negative CAGR alpha** (strategy underperforming buy-and-hold)
- **Recent exit signals** creating contra-indicators
- **Severe negative mark-to-market** performance
- **Late-stage positioning** (holding periods exceeding historical averages)
- **Model-output integrity conflicts** (target ordering issues, reported metrics contradicting current performance)

The analysis reveals a market environment favoring **profit-taking and position management** rather than fresh entries, with multiple signals showing 50%+ gains (ATZ.TO), exceeded targets, or triggered exits.

## FILTERED SIGNALS OUTPUT

|||NONE QUALIFIED FOR TIER A|||

**Explanation:** After applying strict Tier A hard gates (≥70% win rate verification, positive CAGR alpha requirement, timeliness assessment, at-target exclusion, integrity validation), zero signals across all 8 parallel processing groups met the comprehensive approval criteria.

---

## KEY INSIGHTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. **Profit-Taking Environment Dominates**
Multiple high-performing signals have reached or exceeded targets:
- **ATZ.TO**: +50.37% gain, 68.9% progress to next target (LATE)
- **CNQ.TO**: Multiple signals with 17.58-24.38% gains, all targets exceeded
- **AMD**: Three signals spanning 2024-2025, oldest showing 2+ years holding (approaching max historical 2.5 years)
- **SJ.TO**: +22-24% gains with exits triggered (profit-taking complete)

**Recommendation:** Existing positions should prioritize profit-taking over fresh entries. Trail stops and partial exits warranted.

### 2. **Negative CAGR Alpha Widespread**
Numerous signals show strategy underperformance vs buy-and-hold despite high win rates:
- **CNQ.TO**: -5.77% alpha (86.36% win rate)
- **BTI**: -2.78% alpha (95.65% win rate)
- **MTY.TO**: -4.15% alpha (79.17% win rate)
- **DOL.TO**: -10.57% alpha (100% win rate!)
- **NFLX DeltaDrift**: -15.88% alpha (80% win rate)

**Insight:** High win rates do NOT guarantee alpha. Many signals capture tactical moves efficiently but underperform passive exposure over full cycles.

### 3. **Exit Signal Activity Creates Contra-Indicators**
Recent exits reduce authorization confidence for fresh entries:
- **EFA**: Exit triggered 2026-02-18 (+4.37% gain after 24 days)
- **XLU**: Exit triggered 2026-02-18 (+3.19% gain after 8 days)
- **ATM.NZ**: Three signals exited 2026-02-16 to 2026-02-17
- **NVDA**: Exit-entry coincidence suggests signal refresh rather than confirmation
- **NFLX**: Long exit 2026-02-15 (-17.44% loss) creates contra-indicator

**Recommendation:** Wait for re-validation before entering assets with recent exit activity.

### 4. **Multi-Confirmation Signals Show Mixed Results**
Assets with multiple confirmations present complex timing challenges:
- **AMD**: Triple Monthly TrendPulse confirmation (87.5% win rate, +14.63% alpha) but oldest signals 2+ years old
- **MAR**: Triple confirmation (Daily/Weekly TP, Monthly FT) but Monthly already exited
- **MEL.NZ**: Dual Daily/Weekly TP confirmation (88-100% win rates) but both very recent (0-3 days)
- **GS**: Dual Monthly TP but earlier signal at +25.29% gain approaching profit-taking
- **TRI.TO**: Cross-timeframe conflict (Daily Long vs Monthly Short)

**Insight:** Multi-confirmation increases conviction but requires careful timeframe alignment analysis. Older confirmations may be in profit-taking mode while newer ones offer entry opportunities.

### 5. **Severe Integrity Issues Identified**
Multiple signals show critical model-output conflicts:
- **TD.TO Short**: 100% historical win rate with 0% max loss contradicted by current -11.91% MTM
- **C6L.SI Short**: 92.86% win rate contradicted by -9.37% MTM exceeding historical max loss
- **TRI.TO Short**: 20.8% gap between signal price ($150.45) and open price ($181.70)
- **BTI**: Function Specific Target ($57.91) < Entry Anchor ($57.24) for Long signal
- **NFLX FT Short**: First target ($184.13) > Entry ($93.76) for Short (directional error)

**Recommendation:** Signals with integrity conflicts require manual verification before any position action.

### 6. **Forward Testing Shows Strategy Degradation**
Several functions show forward testing underperformance vs backtests:
- **TD.TO DeltaDrift Monthly**: 100% backtest win rate → 0% forward testing win rate (3 trades)
- **NFLX DeltaDrift Weekly**: 80% backtest → strategy breakdown in live period
- **Multiple signals**: Forward testing 63-83% vs backtest 85-100%

**Insight:** Model adaptation or market regime change may be affecting real-time performance. Recent 6-month metrics often stronger than full forward testing, suggesting recent improvement.

### 7. **Geographic and Sector Patterns**
- **Canadian equities** show strength (ATZ.TO +50%, CNQ.TO +17-24%) but negative alpha concerns
- **Semiconductor sector** (AMD, TSM) demonstrates multi-timeframe alignment but late-stage
- **Healthcare** (PPH) shows Daily/Monthly confirmation with 100% Daily win rate
- **New Zealand equities** (MEL.NZ, CNU.NZ, ATM.NZ) present opportunities but profit-taking mode
- **Currency pairs** (GBPUSD=X, NZDCAD=X, JPY=X) show positive momentum but fail win-rate verification

### 8. **Timeframe-Specific Observations**
- **Monthly signals**: Strongest historical win rates (85-100%) but longest holding periods (9-12 months avg)
- **Weekly signals**: Balanced timeframe with 3-4 month holding periods, but many show negative alpha
- **Daily signals**: Shortest holding periods (7-27 days) but higher exit frequency
- **Quarterly signals**: Limited sample (NFLX FT Short) but 100% win rate when present

## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS

### **For Existing Positions:**

1. **Immediate Profit-Taking:**
   - ATZ.TO: +50% gain, take full or partial
   - CNQ.TO: +17-24% gains, all targets exceeded, exit recommended
   - SJ.TO: Exits already triggered, confirm closure
   - AMD (2024 signals): Consider scaling out after 2+ year holds

2. **Trail Stops:**
   - MAR: Trail at $312 (Recent Extrema) or $356 (current)
   - GS (Aug 2025): Trail at $794.58 (F-Stack 1)
   - ^GSPC: Trail at $6,353 (F-Stack 1)
   - PPH: Trail at $104.54 (Recent Extrema)

3. **Exit Immediately:**
   - TD.TO Short: -11.91% loss, strategy breakdown (0% forward testing)
   - C6L.SI Short: -9.37% loss, max loss exceeded
   - SUM.NZ: -7.02% loss, support breached

### **For Fresh Entries:**

**DO NOT ENTER ANY SIGNALS** until:
1. Market regime shift confirmed (multiple fresh signals with <5 days elapsed)
2. At-target signals complete profit-taking and retrace to support
3. Negative CAGR alpha signals demonstrate forward-testing improvement
4. Integrity issues resolved through model output updates

### **Monitoring List (Potential Future Entries):**

**Wait for pullback to support levels:**
1. **MEL.NZ**: 100% Weekly win rate, but 3 days old (wait for retracement to $5.46)
2. **PPH**: 100% Daily win rate, but 5 days old (wait for retracement to $110.57)
3. **SBUX**: 100% Daily FT win rate, but 0 days old (wait for confirmation above $95.76)
4. **TSM**: 100% Monthly win rate, but 9.59% progress (wait for retracement to $311.98)

**Wait for re-validation after exits:**
1. **EFA**: 86.96% win rate, exited 2026-02-18 (wait for new signal)
2. **NFLX**: Wait for new long signal after recent exit failure
3. **MFT.NZ**: Wait for Weekly re-confirmation after recent exit

---

## FINAL ASSESSMENT

**Market Environment:** Late-cycle profit-taking phase. Multiple signals showing extended gains, exceeded targets, and triggered exits. Not conducive to fresh entries under strict risk management criteria.

**Strategy Effectiveness:** Mixed. High win rates (75-100%) common but negative CAGR alpha widespread (31.5% of signals). Forward testing shows strategy degradation in some functions (TD.TO DD: 100% → 0%). Recent 6-month performance stronger than full forward testing, suggesting potential recent improvement or favorable conditions.

**Risk Management Priority:** Protect existing gains through profit-taking and trailing stops. Avoid fresh entries until market regime shift confirmed through new signal generation with favorable timeliness metrics.

**Next Steps:**
1. **Close profit-taking positions** (ATZ.TO, CNQ.TO, SJ.TO, AMD 2024 signals)
2. **Exit failed positions** (TD.TO, C6L.SI shorts)
3. **Trail stops on remaining** (MAR, GS, ^GSPC, PPH)
4. **Monitor for new signals** with <5 days elapsed and positive CAGR alpha
5. **Re-evaluate** when exit activity subsides and fresh confirmations emerge

**DISCLAIMER:**  
This report synthesizes model output from 8 parallel processing results. All metrics, targets, support levels, and performance statistics are reported directly from model output without external data validation. Progress calculations and timeliness assessments were performed only when all required inputs (entry, current price, target) were present in the payload. No guessing or invention of prices, dates, levels, or metrics occurred. **NO SIGNALS QUALIFY FOR TIER A APPROVED RISK** under the strict hard-gate criteria applied. All signals are classified as TIER C HOLD FOR REVIEW and should not be treated as fresh entry recommendations. Independent due diligence, position sizing, and risk management appropriate to individual circumstances are required before any trading action.
