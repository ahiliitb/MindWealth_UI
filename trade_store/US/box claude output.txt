## Conclusion and Recommendations

The analysis reveals several high-quality signals with strong performance metrics and favorable risk-reward profiles. For buy signals, semiconductor stocks (SOXX, AMD, TSM) show particular strength with multiple confirming signals across different functions and timeframes. For sell signals, BABA and NKE stand out with excellent historical win rates and strong CAGR differences.

When implementing these signals, consider the following recommendations:

1. **Position Sizing**: Adjust position sizes based on the historical win rate and max single trade loss to manage risk appropriately.

2. **Stop Loss Placement**: Use the recommended stop loss levels, which are typically placed at key support/resistance levels or Fibonacci retracement levels.

3. **Target Management**: Consider taking partial profits at the first target level while maintaining exposure for higher targets.

4. **Multiple Function Confirmation**: Prioritize signals that have confirmation from multiple functions or timeframes, as these tend to have higher reliability.

5. **Timely Entry**: Focus on signals that are still timely (minimal mark-to-market movement) to maximize potential gains.
