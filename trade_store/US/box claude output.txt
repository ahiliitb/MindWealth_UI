## Rationale for Signal Selection

The signals were filtered and ranked based on the following criteria:

1. **Confirmation Status**: All selected signals are confirmed, reducing the risk of false signals.

2. **Win Rate**: All signals have win rates above 75%, with many exceeding 85% or even reaching 100%.

3. **CAGR Performance**: Selected signals have strong CAGR values (mostly above 15%) or positive CAGR differences compared to buy-and-hold strategies.

4. **Sharpe Ratio**: All signals have Sharpe ratios above 0.75, indicating good risk-adjusted returns.

5. **Latest Performance**: Signals with higher latest performance percentages were given priority, with most selected signals showing performance above 70%.

6. **Current Position**: Signals already showing positive mark-to-market performance were prioritized, particularly those with gains exceeding 10%.

7. **Multi-Function Confirmation**: Signals confirmed by multiple functions (like HDFCBANK.NS) were given additional weight.

8. **Price vs Support/Resistance**: Signals with favorable risk-reward ratios based on the distance to support and resistance levels were selected.

9. **Potential Upside vs Downside**: Signals offering significantly higher potential upside compared to downside risk were prioritized.

10. **Interval Preference**: Monthly signals were generally preferred over weekly, and weekly over daily, though exceptions were made for signals with exceptional metrics.
