## Key Insights and Recommendations

1. **Strong signals across multiple sectors** - Our filtered signals include energy (CNQ.TO), financials/conglomerates (BRK-B), technology (SOXX, AMD), travel/hospitality (ABNB), retail (ATD.TO), healthcare (NVO), and diversified holdings (BN.TO), providing excellent sector diversification.

2. **Recent signals with high win rates** - Most filtered signals have exceptional historical win rates (85-100%) and were generated within the past 10 days, ensuring optimal timeliness.

3. **Positive CAGR differentials** - Most signals show strategy CAGR outperforming buy-and-hold approaches, particularly BN.TO (+20.53%) and CNQ.TO (+10.1%), indicating robust alpha generation potential.

4. **Balanced timeframes** - The mix of daily, weekly and quarterly signals allows for both short-term tactical positioning and medium-term strategic allocation.

5. **Both long and short opportunities** - While most signals are long, the inclusion of AMD short provides a hedging opportunity against technology sector weakness.

6. **Risk management considerations** - For each signal, we've identified appropriate stop-loss levels based on technical support levels and historical drawdown patterns to manage downside risk.

7. **International exposure** - The inclusion of Canadian (BN.TO, CNQ.TO, ATD.TO) and European (NVO) assets provides geographical diversification beyond US markets.

8. **Semiconductor sector shows both long and short opportunities** - SOXX (long) and AMD (short) provide interesting paired exposure to different segments of the semiconductor industry.
