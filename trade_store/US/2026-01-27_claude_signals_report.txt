**Targets & Support:**
- **Target Prices:** $103.1291 / $103.6289 / $105.73
- **Support Levels:** $98.00 (Breakout Level) / $91.35 (EMA 200) / $75.02 (Recent Extrema)
- **Potential Upside:** 3.14% to 3.66% immediate

**Risk-Reward Analysis:**
- **Entry Anchor:** $98.00 (TrendPulse breakout level)
- **Recommended Stop Loss:** $98.00 (Breakout level, -3.6% from current)
  - *Rationale: Invalidates breakout thesis if broken*
- **Recommended Take Profit:** $103.13 (Historic Rise, +1.4% from current)
  - *Rationale: Conservative near-term; scale to $105.73 if international markets strengthen*

**Timeliness:** ⚠️ **PARTIALLY TIMELY** - 46% progress, but validated by +1.70% momentum in 2 days  
**Cycle Context:** Mid Expansion (4-year ~55%) → **Neutral**

**P/E:** 19.62 (MSCI EAFE avg)

**Notes:** Strong 85.71% win rate with superior Sharpe (0.40 vs 0.03). International diversification away from US concentration. European stabilization and attractive valuations vs US (P/E 19.62 vs ~28 S&P). Modest targets reflect conservative ETF movements but high win rate makes risk-adjusted attractive.
