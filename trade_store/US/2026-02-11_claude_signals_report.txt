# COMPREHENSIVE SIGNAL SYNTHESIS REPORT

**ANALYSIS_DATE: 2026-02-11**

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

After synthesizing results from 6 parallel processing groups analyzing multiple signal datasets, **only 4 unique signals** across 4 distinct assets pass structural parseability and contain sufficient data for detailed analysis. However, **ZERO signals qualify for Tier A approved risk** due to systematic missing field issues, primarily the absence of explicitly named `full_history_win_rate` fields required by Gate A2 policy.

The analysis reveals a **critical data infrastructure gap**: while all signals demonstrate strong reported win rates (80-100%), the strict field-naming requirements of the conservative filtering framework prevent Tier A authorization. This represents a **policy/technical barrier rather than fundamental signal quality concerns**.

## KEY INSIGHTS AND STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. **Systematic Data Infrastructure Gap Blocks Authorization**
All 7 identified signals fail Tier A qualification due to **missing `full_history_win_rate` field** (explicit field naming requirement per Gate A2). While signals report win rates via composite fields like "Win Rate [%], History Tested, Number of Trades" showing 80-100% success rates, the conservative framework requires exact field naming for automated verification. This is a **technical/policy barrier, not a signal quality issue**.

### 2. **Strong Historical Performance Across All Signals**
Despite Tier A exclusions, reported metrics show exceptional quality:
- **AAPL Quarterly FRACTAL TRACK**: 100% win rate (5 trades, 45 years), Sharpe 1.91
- **META Weekly FRACTAL TRACK**: 100% win rate (6 trades, 13 years), Sharpe 8.93, +3.17% CAGR alpha
- **^DJI Monthly TRENDPULSE**: 85.71% win rate (14 trades, 20 years), Sharpe 1.23, +1.85% CAGR alpha
- **EURUSD=X Daily FRACTAL TRACK**: 83.33% win rate (12 trades, 5 years), +4.23% CAGR alpha
- **AMZN Daily DELTADRIFT**: 80% win rate (15 trades, 4 years)
- **AAPL Weekly FRACTAL TRACK**: 93.75% win rate (16 trades, 20 years), Sharpe 2.32
- **BTC-USD Daily DELTADRIFT**: 80% win rate (15 trades, 4 years)

### 3. **CAGR Alpha Shows Mixed Long-Term Value**
Critical divergence in strategy value-add:
- **Positive Alpha** (outperforms buy-and-hold):
  - EURUSD=X: +4.23% | ^DJI: +1.85% | AMZN: +3.25% | META: +3.17%
- **Negative Alpha** (underperforms buy-and-hold):
  - AAPL Weekly: -5.48% | AAPL Quarterly: -0.26% | BTC-USD: -8.74%

**Implication**: High win rates don't guarantee alpha. AAPL and BTC signals show excellent tactical win rates but underperform passive holding, suggesting they're better for short-term trades than long-term positions.

### 4. **Timeliness Profile: Mix of Fresh and Established Signals**
- **Very Fresh (0-5 days)**: AMZN (0d), EURUSD=X (1d), AAPL Weekly (3d), META (3d), BTC-USD (5d)
- **Early Stage (11-42 days)**: ^DJI (11d), AAPL Quarterly (42d/1.4 months)

All signals pass timeliness gates where computable, with minimal progress toward targets (0-4.8% where measured).

### 5. **Multi-Timeframe Confirmation: AAPL Shows Strongest Alignment**
**AAPL** is the only asset with **dual-timeframe confirmation**:
- Weekly FRACTAL TRACK (93.75% win rate, Sharpe 2.32)
- Quarterly FRACTAL TRACK (100% win rate, Sharpe 1.91)

Both track 38.2% Fibonacci retracement bounce-back patterns from different reference upmoves, increasing conviction through cross-timeframe validation. However, both show negative CAGR alpha, suggesting tactical rather than strategic positioning.

### 6. **Sector/Asset Class Diversification**
Signals span multiple asset classes:
- **US Equities**: AAPL (2 signals), AMZN, META
- **Indices**: ^DJI
- **Forex**: EURUSD=X
- **Crypto**: BTC-USD

**Geographic/Sector Exposure**: Concentration in US mega-cap tech (3 of 4 equity signals) suggests sector-specific momentum but limited diversification.

### 7. **Risk Management Framework Present But Incomplete**
All signals provide:
- ✅ Multiple target levels (T1/T2 + extended targets)
- ✅ Support/stop references (Recent Extrema, F-Stack, Horizontal, EMA 200)
- ❌ Missing `rr_to_nearest_support_stop` (precomputed risk-reward ratios)
- ❌ Missing `lateness_gate` and `progress` fields (standardized timeliness metrics)

Manual computation possible but adds interpretation risk.

### 8. **Forward Testing & Recent Performance Data Absent**
**Critical Gap**: No signals include forward testing or last-6-months performance data. All rely solely on historical backtests (4-45 years depending on signal). Cannot verify:
- Out-of-sample performance
- Strategy adaptation to current market regime
- Recent win-rate trends

### 9. **F-Stack Resistance Proximity Concerns**
Major tech stocks approaching/at monthly resistance bands:
- **AAPL**: $275.90 current vs $273.45-$276.77 resistance band (within band)
- **META**: $669.20 current vs $722.28 next resistance (+7.9%)
- **AMZN**: $203.88 current vs $243.94 resistance (+19.6%)

**Implication**: Near-term overhead resistance may limit upside for AAPL Weekly/Quarterly signals until breakout confirmed.

### 10. **Current Mark-to-Market Shows Mixed Early Performance**
- **Positive MTM**: AMZN (0%), EURUSD=X (+0.19%), AAPL Quarterly (+1.49%), META (+1.17%), ^DJI (+2.6%)
- **Negative MTM**: AAPL Weekly (-0.8%), BTC-USD (-4.37%)

**BTC-USD concern**: 4.37% underwater after 5 days with negative alpha (-8.74%) raises questions about signal viability.

## A) SIGNAL SYNOPSIS (as of 2026-02-11)

**Composite Alignment**: 7 signals identified across 6 assets, spanning Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Quarterly intervals and 3 distinct functions (DELTADRIFT, FRACTAL TRACK, TRENDPULSE). No mechanical contradictions or contra indicators detected (no recent exit signals present). However, **systematic field-naming gaps prevent Tier A authorization** for all signals despite strong reported historical performance (80-100% win rates).

**Key Tension**: Exceptional historical metrics vs. technical policy barriers create a **"high-quality signals, zero approvals"** paradox requiring urgent data infrastructure resolution.

---

## B) TIER A — RANKED QUALIFIED SIGNALS

### **ZERO TIER A QUALIFIED SIGNALS**

**Universal Exclusion Reason**: All 7 signals fail **Gate A2 (Tier A policy: win-rate requirement)** due to missing explicit `full_history_win_rate` field naming.

**Specific Exclusions**:

1. **AMZN/Daily/DELTADRIFT** (Row 1, Group 1)
   - **Issue**: Tier A policy exclusion — not available in model output: missing `full_history_win_rate` field; cannot verify ≥70% requirement; excluded from Tier A.
   - **Reported Win Rate**: 80% (would satisfy threshold if field present)

2. **EURUSD=X/Daily/FRACTAL TRACK** (Row 1, Group 2)
   - **Issue**: Same as above
   - **Reported Win Rate**: 83.33% (would satisfy threshold)

3. **AAPL/Weekly/FRACTAL TRACK** (Row 1, Group 3)
   - **Issue**: Same as above
   - **Reported Win Rate**: 93.75% (would satisfy threshold)

4. **AAPL/Quarterly/FRACTAL TRACK** (Row 2, Group 3)
   - **Issue**: Same as above
   - **Reported Win Rate**: 100% (would satisfy threshold)

5. **META/Weekly/FRACTAL TRACK** (Row 1, Group 4)
   - **Issue**: Same as above
   - **Reported Win Rate**: 100% (would satisfy threshold)

6. **BTC-USD/Daily/DELTADRIFT** (Row 1, Group 5)
   - **Issue**: Same as above
   - **Reported Win Rate**: 80% (would satisfy threshold)

7. **^DJI/Monthly/TRENDPULSE** (Row 1, Group 6)
   - **Issue**: Same as above
   - **Reported Win Rate**: 85.71% (would satisfy threshold)

**Policy Framework Note**: Per strict operating principle 2.1 ("Never guess / never invent"), the framework cannot assume composite fields like "Win Rate [%], History Tested, Number of Trades" are equivalent to the required `full_history_win_rate` field without explicit field naming in payload structure. This is a **data infrastructure issue, not a signal quality issue**.

---

## C) TIER C — HOLD FOR REVIEW (Informational Transparency)

Given the systematic Gate A2 failures, the following signals are placed in **Tier C for transparency and monitoring**, ranked by multi-timeframe confirmation and historical performance quality:

---

### **1. AAPL — Long — 2 timeframe confirmations**

**HOLD FOR REVIEW — Policy Exclusion (Win-Rate Field Format)**

**Synopsis**: Dual-timeframe FRACTAL TRACK confirmation (Weekly + Quarterly) with exceptional historical win rates (93.75% and 100%). Both signals track 38.2% Fibonacci retracement bounce-back patterns. However, both show negative CAGR alpha (-5.48% Weekly, -0.26% Quarterly), indicating underperformance vs. buy-and-hold despite high win rates. Current price ($275.90) within Monthly F-Stack resistance band ($273.45-$276.77), suggesting near-term consolidation risk.

---

#### **Signal 1: AAPL/Weekly/FRACTAL TRACK**

- Max Loss: -9.56%

**Timeliness**: PASSED (3 days elapsed, minimal progress, fresh signal)

**Contra Indicator**: F-Stack Monthly resistance at $275.11 (current $275.90 within band) may cause near-term consolidation.

---

#### **Signal 2: AAPL/Quarterly/FRACTAL TRACK**

**Row Identifier**: AAPL/Long/FRACTAL TRACK/Quarterly/Row 2 (Group 3)

**Exclusion Reason**: Missing explicit `full_history_win_rate` field (reported as composite "Win Rate [%]: 100%")

**Signal Details**:
- **Signal Date/Price**: 2025-12-31 @ $271.86
- **Today's Price**: 2026-02-11 @ $275.90 (+1.49% from signal)

- **Elapsed Time**: 1.4 months (42 days)
- **Signal Type**: Upmove Bounce Back, 38.2% retracement from $22.37-$260.10 (2016-2024)
- **Track Level**: $169.29 (current price +62.98% above)

**Targets**:
- T1 (Historic Rise to Pivot): $390.15 (+41.43% from current)
- T2 (Avg Historical Gain): $368.78 (+33.67%)
- Function Target: $414.50 (+50.25%)

**Risk References**:
- Recent Extrema: $23.90 (91.33% below current — **model-output integrity issue**: likely split-adjusted historical low, not practical stop)
- EMA 200: $239.58 (-13.16% from current — more practical support)

**Historical Performance**:
- Win Rate: 100% (5 trades, 45 years)
- Sharpe: 1.91 (vs 0.74 buy-and-hold)
- CAGR: 12.11% (Strategy) vs 12.37% (Buy & Hold)
- **CAGR Alpha: -0.26%** (slight underperformance)
- Avg Win: 35.65% over avg 10.6 months
- Max Loss: 0% (no losing trades)

**Timeliness**: PASSED (1.4 months elapsed = 13.2% of avg 10.6-month hold period; 3.4% progress toward T1)

**Model-Output Integrity Issue**: Recent Extrema at $23.90 appears to reference 2016 starting point, not a practical stop level.

---

**Multi-Timeframe Assessment**: Both signals represent bounce-back patterns from 38.2% Fibonacci retracements but at vastly different scales (Weekly: 7-month upmove; Quarterly: 8-year upmove). Convergence increases conviction, but negative alpha on both suggests these are tactical short-term opportunities rather than long-term holds. F-Stack resistance proximity ($275.11 band) requires monitoring for breakout confirmation before expecting acceleration toward targets.

---

### **2. META — Long — 1 confirmation**

**HOLD FOR REVIEW — Policy Exclusion (Win-Rate Field Format)**

---

### **6. BTC-USD — Long — 1 confirmation**

**HOLD FOR REVIEW — Policy Exclusion + Performance Concerns**

**Row Identifier**: BTC-USD/Long/DELTADRIFT/Daily/Row 1 (Group 5)

**Exclusion Reason**: Missing explicit `full_history_win_rate` field (reported as composite "Win Rate [%]: 80%")

**Signal Details**:
- **Signal Date/Price**: 2026-02-06 @ $70,555.39
- **Today's Price**: 2026-02-11 @ $67,471.81 (-4.37% from signal — **underwater**)
- **Confirmation**: CONFIRMED on 2026-02-06
- **Elapsed Time**: 5 days

**Targets**:
- T1 (Historic Rise to Pivot): $72,573.27 (+7.6% from current)
- T2 (Avg Historical Gain): $74,760.49 (+10.8%)

**Risk References**:
- Recent Extrema: $62,702.10 (-7.1% from current)
- F-Stack 1 Support: $57,447.22 (-14.9%)

**Historical Performance**:
- Win Rate: 80% (15 trades, 4 years)

- **CAGR Alpha: -8.74%** (severe underperformance vs passive)
- Avg Win: 5.96% over avg 10 days
- Max Loss: -26.18%

**Timeliness**: Cannot fully evaluate (missing fields); 5 days elapsed vs 10-day avg hold suggests mid-stage, but negative MTM (-4.37%) raises concerns.

**Model-Output Integrity Issue**: Signal Price ($70,555.39) vs Signal Open Price ($62,704.45) — 11.2% discrepancy; unclear which is true entry reference.

**CRITICAL CONCERN**: Negative CAGR alpha (-8.74%) combined with current underwater position (-4.37%) and model-output price conflicts suggest **AVOID NEW ENTRY**. If already in position, monitor Recent Extrema support at $62,702.10 closely for stop-loss execution.

---

## D) REJECTION SUMMARY

### **Policy-Based Exclusions (Gate A2 Failures):**

**Total Rejected from Tier A: 7 rows** (all signals)

All 7 signals fail **Gate A2 (Tier A policy: win-rate requirement)** due to:

**Not available in model output — missing explicit `full_history_win_rate` field for all rows → cannot verify ≥70% requirement per strict field-naming policy; therefore excluded from Tier A.**

**Specific Rows:**
1. AMZN/Daily/DELTADRIFT (reported 80% via composite field)
2. EURUSD=X/Daily/FRACTAL TRACK (reported 83.33%)
3. AAPL/Weekly/FRACTAL TRACK (reported 93.75%)
4. AAPL/Quarterly/FRACTAL TRACK (reported 100%)
5. META/Weekly/FRACTAL TRACK (reported 100%)
6. BTC-USD/Daily/DELTADRIFT (reported 80%)
7. ^DJI/Monthly/TRENDPULSE (reported 85.71%)

**Impact**: While all reported win rates would satisfy the ≥70% threshold substantively, the strict operating principle 2.1 ("Never guess / never invent") prevents assuming composite fields like "Win Rate [%], History Tested, Number of Trades" are equivalent to required `full_history_win_rate` field without explicit naming.

---

### **Structural Parse Failures (Gate A0):**

**Portfolio Aggregation Tables** (26+ aggregated rows across all groups):
- **Reason**: Not available in model output — missing individual signal identifiers (Symbol per trade, Signal Date, Signal Price, Entry Anchor, Targets, Support) for portfolio aggregation rows → cannot parse individual signals for Tier A evaluation.
- **Impact**: Aggregate statistics (e.g., "DELTADRIFT Long Daily: 80% closed win rate across 35 closed trades") provide portfolio context but cannot substitute for individual signal-level data.

**Horizontal Report Rows** (EURUSD=X, ^TNX):
- **Reason**: Not available in model output — missing Direction, Function, Signal Date, Entry anchor, Targets, Performance metrics → cannot frame trades.
- **Impact**: Proximity to horizontal support levels noted but unusable for Tier A without directional signal and historical performance data.

**F-Stack Analyzer Report Rows** (GOOG, AAPL, AMZN, META):
- **Reason**: Not available in model output — missing Direction (Resistance/Semi-Resistance are descriptive, not Long/Short signals), Function identity (signal generator), Entry anchor, Performance metrics → cannot frame trades.
- **Impact**: F-Stack levels successfully used as target/support references in qualified signals, but F-Stack rows themselves are not standalone entry signals.

**New High Report Rows**:
- **Reason**: All fields NaN across all groups → unparseable.

---

### **Duplicates Removed:**

None identified (no duplicate signals across groups).

---

### **Additional Missing Dependencies:**

All 7 signals lack:
1. **`lateness_gate` field**: Cannot perform deterministic timeliness evaluation (Gate A3)
2. **`progress` field**: Cannot compute lateness without guessing
3. **`rr_to_nearest_support_stop` field**: Cannot evaluate risk-reward waiver for lateness
4. **Forward testing fields**: Cannot verify recent out-of-sample performance
5. **Last 6 months performance fields**: Cannot assess very recent strategy behavior

**Impact**: Ranking tie-breaks skipped; timeliness assessments rely on manual computation under allowed rules (2.3) where inputs exist.
