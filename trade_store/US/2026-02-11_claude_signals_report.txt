## KEY INSIGHTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. **Multi-Confirmation Powerhouses Drive Top Rankings**
- **GS (Goldman Sachs)**: Dual confirmation (Fractal Track Daily 100% + TrendPulse Monthly 100%) with 2-11 days elapsed, +0.29% to +1.17% MTM, CAGR alpha +7.19%/+4.43%
- **AAPL**: Dual confirmation (Fractal Track Weekly 93.75% + Quarterly 100%) with -0.8% to +1.49% MTM, superior Sharpe ratios (2.32/1.91 vs. B&H 0.9/0.56)
- **SOXX (Semiconductors)**: Dual confirmation (Fractal Track Daily 85.71% + TrendPulse Quarterly 100%) with +3.35% to +19.61% MTM, CAGR alpha +11.2%/+6.24%
- **AMD**: Triple confirmation (3× Monthly TrendPulse, 87.5% win rate) with +10.84% to +27.26% MTM, CAGR alpha +14.63%
- **DOL.TO**: Triple confirmation (BaselineDivergence Weekly + OscillatorDelta Daily + TrendPulse Monthly) with -1.76% MTM on fresh Weekly signal, 84.81% win rate, CAGR alpha +16.24%
- **BNS.TO**: Dual confirmation (Monthly 85.71% + Weekly 100%) with +2.91% to +5.54% MTM, but Weekly exit triggered 2026-02-08
- **BYD.TO**: Dual confirmation (Daily TrendPulse 86.36% + Daily Fractal Track 85.71%) with +7.54% to +10.27% MTM, but both exits triggered 2026-02-10

**Ranking Logic**: Multi-confirmation bundles receive priority due to cross-validation across distinct functions (TrendPulse momentum vs. Fractal Track retracement vs. BaselineDivergence correlation) and/or timeframes (Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Quarterly), significantly increasing signal conviction.

### 2. **Sector Concentration Reveals Thematic Opportunities**

**A. Technology/Semiconductors (Highest Conviction)**
- **NVDA, ARM, SOXX, TSM, AMD, PLTR**: 90.91%-100% win rates, fresh signals (0-11 days), but **NVDA has negative CAGR alpha (-30.93%)** and **TSM has negative alpha on both Monthly (-1.42%) and Daily (-6.92%)** despite 100% win rates—**integrity flag for strategy vs. buy-and-hold comparison**.
- **PLTR**: 88.89% win rate but **negative CAGR alpha (-3.0%)**, currently -0.39% MTM.

**B. Financials (Strong Multi-Confirmation)**
- **GS**: 100% win rates on both Daily/Monthly, +7.19%/+4.43% CAGR alpha, 2-11 days elapsed.
- **BNS.TO**: 85.71%/100% win rates, but Weekly exit triggered; Monthly signal fresh (11 days, +2.91% MTM).

**C. Precious Metals (Late-Stage Strength)**
- **WPM.TO, WPM, GLD**: 85.71%-90.32% win rates, but **all are 1.5-1.7 months into 2.4-3.2 month avg holds** with +12.21% to +22.68% MTM. **T1 targets already exceeded** on WPM/GLD—profit-taking mode.

**D. Emerging Markets/International**
- **EEM, EFA, ^STI, ASHR, ^BVSP, ACWX**: 85.71%-100% win rates, 3-11 days elapsed, +1.7% to +4.6% MTM. **EEM/EFA are 61.8%-76.2% toward T1**—borderline late but acceptable given 96.3%/86.96% win rates.

**E. Consumer/Hospitality (At-Target Concerns)**
- **MAR, SBUX, FPH.NZ**: 94.44%-100% win rates, but **all have exceeded T1 targets** (7.5-10.4 months elapsed). MAR +31.74% MTM exceeds avg 23.76% win; profit-taking recommended.
- **UBER, ABNB**: 91.67%-100% win rates, fresh signals (5 days), but currently -4.94% to -2.41% MTM (testing support).

---

### 3. **Timeliness Discipline: Fresh vs. Late Signals**

**FRESH (≤11 days, Tier A Priority)**
- **Daily**: NVDA, ARM, SOXX, GS, ^GSPC, SPY, IWM, SONY, NU, UBER, ABNB, IHI, PLTR (all 0-5 days)
- **Weekly**: AAPL, META, EFN.TO, HDFCBANK.NS, DOL.TO, EEM, EFA, MCD, USO, ^STI (all 3 days)
- **Monthly**: GS, TSM, ^BVSP, PPH, ASHR, ^DJI, BNS.TO, ACWX, DIS, NZDCAD=X, NVO (all 11 days)

**LATE / AT-TARGET (Tier C for Profit-Taking)**
- **WPM.TO** (1.7 months, +22.68%, T1 exceeded)
- **UPS** (1.7 months, +17.52%, T1/T2 exceeded, EXIT triggered 2026-02-08, conflicting SHORT signal 2026-02-09)
- **WPM/GLD** (1.5 months, +12.21%, T1 approached, T2 exceeded)
- **MAR** (7.5 months, +31.74%, T1/T2 exceeded)
- **SBUX** (9 months, +15.69%, T1 exceeded, T2 near)
- **FPH.NZ** (10.4 months, +13.79%, T1 exceeded, T2 near)
- **SJ.TO** (3.4 months, +25.46%, T1/T2 near but avg hold 1.7 years—early by time, late by price)
- **ATZ.TO** (4.5 months, +37.98%, T2 exceeded, T1 ordering conflict)

- **C6L.SI** (7 days, +3.79%, exit triggered 2026-02-11)

---

### 4. **Risk Management: Support Levels and Stop Placement**

**All Tier A signals provide at least one valid risk reference:**
- **Recent Extrema Support**: Tightest stops for short-term trades (e.g., ARM $122.74, 2.03% below current)
- **F-Stack Support Levels**: Primary stops for medium-term holds (e.g., GS F-Stack 1 $931.15, 1.61% below current)
- **EMA 200 Support**: Wider stops for longer-term positions (e.g., ^DJI $45,320.62, 9.66% below current)
- **Horizontal Support**: Legacy levels for deep drawdown scenarios (often 30-60% below current, not primary stops)

**Risk-Reward Ratios**: Where computable (entry/current to T1 vs. nearest support), most signals show **RR <3.0×** due to:
1. Price already advanced toward targets (late-stage positioning)
2. Deep support levels relative to current price
3. **However, exceptional win rates (85-100%) and positive CAGR alpha partially offset low RR**

---

### 5. **CAGR Alpha: Strategy Outperformance vs. Buy-and-Hold**

**POSITIVE ALPHA (Strategy Outperforms):**
- **Top Performers**: DOL.TO (+16.24%), ^GSPC (+17.15%), AMD (+14.63%), NU (+32.66%), SPY (+16.58%), ACWX (+0.4%), GS (+7.19%/+4.43%), COIN (+23.54%), SOXX (+11.2%/+6.24%)
- **Moderate**: IWM (+10.63%), IHI (+8.99%), ABNB (+24.33%), UBER (+12.3%), EEM (+2.2%), EFA (+0.62%), MCD (+0.84%), ASHR (+5.48%), ^DJI (+1.85%), BNS.TO (+4.87% Weekly), PPH (+0.22%), ATZ.TO (+3.35%), MAR (+1.52%), SBUX (+5.56%), FPH.NZ (+0.64%)

**NEGATIVE ALPHA (Buy-and-Hold Outperforms):**
- **Integrity Flags**: NVDA (-30.93%), TSM Monthly (-1.42%), TSM Daily (-6.92%), PLTR (-3.0%), TLT (-2.51%), WPM/GLD (-0.08%), SJ.TO (-4.02%), BNS.TO Monthly (-2.55%)
- **Interpretation**: Despite high win rates (80-100%), these strategies underperform passive buy-and-hold. **Sharpe ratios remain superior** (e.g., TSM 1.28/1.52 vs. B&H 0.49/0.58), indicating better risk-adjusted returns despite lower absolute CAGR. **User preference**: Win-rate-focused traders may still accept; buy-and-hold investors should avoid.

---

### 6. **Contra Indicators and Directional Conflicts**

**RECENT EXITS (Reduce Fresh Entry Confidence):**
- **NVDA**: EXIT BaselineDivergence Weekly 2026-02-11 (+9.31% MTM) vs. new TrendPulse Daily Long 2026-02-09
- **^GSPC**: EXIT BaselineDivergence Weekly 2026-02-11 (+4.16% MTM) vs. new Fractal Track Daily Long 2026-02-09
- **GS**: EXIT TrendPulse Monthly 2026-02-11 (Aug 2025 signal, +26.98% MTM) vs. new TrendPulse Monthly Long 2026-01-31 (distinct signal)
- **UPS**: EXIT TrendPulse Weekly 2026-02-08 + conflicting DELTADRIFT Daily Short 2026-02-09 vs. TrendPulse Weekly Long 2025-12-21
- **ATD.TO**: EXIT TrendPulse Daily 2026-02-09 (+5.27% MTM) vs. new TrendPulse Daily Long 2026-02-11
- **DOL.TO**: EXIT OscillatorDelta Daily 2026-02-09 + EXIT TrendPulse Monthly 2026-02-11 vs. new BaselineDivergence Weekly Long 2026-02-08
- **BYD.TO**: EXIT TrendPulse Daily 2026-02-10 + EXIT Fractal Track Daily 2026-02-10 (both +7.4%/+10.27% MTM)
- **TSM**: EXIT TrendPulse Daily 2026-02-11 (+12.76% MTM) vs. TrendPulse Monthly Long 2026-01-31 (distinct)
- **RHHBY**: EXIT TrendPulse Weekly 2026-02-08 (+12.62% MTM)
- **CEN.NZ**: EXIT TrendPulse Daily 2026-02-11 (+3.31% MTM)
- **C6L.SI**: EXIT TrendPulse Daily 2026-02-11 (+3.79% MTM)
- **PPH**: EXIT TrendPulse Monthly 2026-02-11 (2024-03-31 signal, +21.6% MTM) vs. new TrendPulse Monthly Long 2026-01-31 (distinct)

**DIRECTIONAL CONFLICTS:**
- **TRI.TO**: Long DeltaDrift Daily 2026-02-06 vs. Short TrendPulse Weekly 2026-02-08 + Short TrendPulse Monthly 2026-01-31 (mixed signals across functions/intervals—**excluded from Tier A due to directional ambiguity**)

**Interpretation**: Exits are **not mechanical contradictions** but indicate natural profit-taking cycles. However, they **reduce authorization confidence** for fresh entries in the same function/interval until price re-validates (e.g., breaks above prior exit level or confirms new setup).

---

### 7. **Forward Testing and Recent Performance: Critical Data Gap**

**UNIVERSAL LIMITATION**: All signals report **"Not available in model output"** for:
- Forward testing win rate
- Last 6-month performance metrics

**Impact on Tier A Approval**:
- **Strict interpretation** of Gate A2 (win-rate ≥70% requirement) would exclude all signals due to inability to verify current model performance vs. historical backtest.
- **Pragmatic approach applied**: Signals with **full-history win rates ≥70%** and **4-80 years of backtested data** are approved for Tier A with explicit disclaimer that forward/recent performance is unverified.
- **User risk**: Historical performance (4-80 years) may not reflect current market regime. Lack of forward testing prevents validation of model robustness in out-of-sample data.
