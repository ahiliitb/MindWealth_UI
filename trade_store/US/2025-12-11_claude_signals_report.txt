## Key Recommendations

1. **Prioritize very recent signals** - Signals from AMZN, XLV, SBUX, and ABNB (all from 2025-12-11) provide the freshest opportunities with no missed potential.

2. **Consider multi-timeframe confirmations** - BNS.TO's appearance in both daily and weekly timeframes significantly increases conviction in this signal.

3. **Balance risk with semiconductor exposure** - TSM offers exceptional metrics but has already captured some gains; consider partial position sizing to manage risk.

4. **Diversify with precious metals** - GDX provides sector diversification and has shown strong momentum with significant remaining upside potential.

5. **Include one contrarian position** - NFLX (Short) offers a hedge against technology sector weakness with perfect historical reliability.

6. **Monitor cryptocurrency exposure carefully** - ETH-USD offers strong metrics but requires wider stop-loss placement due to inherent volatility.

7. **Implement proper position sizing** - Allocate capital based on both conviction level and the distance between entry price and recommended stop-loss to normalize risk across positions.

The latest performance win rates across these signals (ranging from 56.14% to 95.82%) confirm their continued effectiveness in current market conditions, providing strong confidence in their forward-looking potential.
