- BABA Weekly FRACTAL TRACK: +16.99%
- USO Daily TRENDPULSE: +17.24%
- WMT Daily FRACTAL TRACK: +15.47%

### 4. **Timeliness Analysis: Fresh vs Late Signals**

**Same-Day/Very Recent Signals (0-4 days):**
- WMT Daily FRACTAL TRACK (0 days)
- BRK-B Daily OSCILLATOR DELTA (0 days)
- XLU Daily OSCILLATOR DELTA (0 days)
- USO Daily TRENDPULSE (1-3 days)
- VGT Daily TRENDPULSE (2 days)
- MCD Daily TRENDPULSE (2 days)
- EEM Daily TRENDPULSE (2 days)
- XLU Weekly FRACTAL TRACK (4 days)

- WMT Monthly FRACTAL TRACK: 7 months, +20.08% MTM
- XLU Monthly FRACTAL TRACK: 10 months, +20.08% MTM
- VGT Monthly TRENDPULSE: 5 months, +9.15% MTM, R:R 5.69×
- ASML Monthly signals: Significant gains already captured

**Action:** Prioritize fresh signals for new entries; manage late signals for profit-taking.

### 5. **Risk Management Through Defined Support Levels**

All qualified signals include clearly identified support levels from multiple methodologies:
- **Recent Extrema:** Short-term support/resistance
- **Horizontal Levels:** Historical price zones
- **F-Stack Support:** Fibonacci-based structural levels
- **F-Track Levels:** Retracement-based entry zones
- **EMA 200:** Dynamic long-term support

**Example - XLU Support Structure:**
- Recent Extrema: $40.53
- EMA 200: $42.42
- F-Stack 1 Support: $35.43
- Provides 10-20% downside cushion for stop-loss placement

### 6. **Forward Testing Validation**

**Strongest Forward Test Hit Rates:**
- FRACTAL TRACK: 74.31-76.0% across timeframes
- TRENDPULSE: 78.95-82.89% across timeframes
- BAND MATRIX: 75.98-80.68%
- OSCILLATOR DELTA: 63.74% (lower but acceptable)

**Consistency Check:**
- Most signals show forward test rates within 5-15% of historical win rates
- Significant divergences flagged (e.g., NFLX FRACTAL TRACK: 100% historical vs 53% forward)

### 7. **Strategy Efficiency: Sharpe Ratios Dominate Buy-and-Hold**

**Average Sharpe Improvements:**
- Strategy Sharpe: 0.5-3.5 range
- Buy-and-Hold Sharpe: 0.0-0.9 range
- **Average improvement: 2-5× better risk-adjusted returns**

**Interpretation:** Even when CAGR differences are negative, superior Sharpe ratios indicate better downside protection and more consistent returns.

### 8. **Timeframe Distribution for Optimal Positioning**

- **Daily Signals (45%):** Short-term tactical (avg hold: 15-30 days)
- **Weekly Signals (30%):** Medium-term swing (avg hold: 1-3 months)
- **Monthly Signals (20%):** Long-term strategic (avg hold: 6-18 months)
- **Quarterly Signals (5%):** Ultra-long-term (avg hold: 1-3 years)

**Portfolio Construction:** Blend timeframes for diversified holding periods and reduced correlation.

## REJECTION SUMMARY

**Total Rejected:** 28+ rows across all groups

### **Primary Rejection Reasons:**

#### **1. Missing Full-History Win Rate (Conservative Eligibility)**
- **Count:** 5 rows
- **Examples:** AAPL DELTADRIFT, META TRENDPULSE, ORCL TRENDPULSE, IHI DELTADRIFT, RHHBY TRENDPULSE
- **Reason:** "Not available in dataset — missing full_history_win_rate → cannot confirm ≥70% eligibility threshold; excluded per conservative policy"
- **Note:** Several of these showed strong apparent win rates (80-100%) but lacked explicit "full_history_win_rate" field; conservative interpretation required exclusion

#### **2. Negative CAGR Difference (Strategy Underperforms Buy-and-Hold)**
- **Count:** 6 rows
- **Examples:** 
  - AAPL FRACTAL TRACK Quarterly: -0.26% CAGR difference
  - AAPL TRENDPULSE Monthly: -3.72% CAGR difference
  - MSFT FRACTAL TRACK: -8.31% CAGR difference
  - NVO SIGMASHELL Daily: -9.76% CAGR difference
  - JPY=X BAND MATRIX Weekly: -0.25% CAGR difference
- **Reason:** Strategy does not add value over passive buy-and-hold despite acceptable win rates

#### **3. Lateness (Progress >60%, R:R <3.0×, Signal Age Excessive)**
- **Count:** 8 rows
- **Examples:**
  - AAPL TRENDPULSE Monthly: 1.4 years old (488 days)
  - PG SIGMASHELL Daily (2 signals): 4-6 months old with negative MTM
  - CSCO TRENDPULSE Daily: 79.66% progress, R:R 0.09×
  - MTY.TO TRENDPULSE Daily: 11.7 months old, exit signal triggered
  - NVO SIGMASHELL Daily (3 signals): 300-455 days old, -3% to -46% MTM
- **Reason:** Signal too advanced, unfavorable risk-reward, or stale (exceeded typical holding period)

#### **4. Exit Signal Already Triggered**
- **Count:** 5 rows
- **Examples:**
  - JETS OSCILLATOR DELTA Daily (2 signals): Exit signals 2026-01-27/28
  - MX.TO BAND MATRIX Daily: Exit signal 2026-01-28
  - JPY=X BAND MATRIX Weekly: Exit signal 2026-01-29 (today)
  - SFTBY FRACTAL TRACK Quarterly: Exit signal 2026-01-29 (today)
- **Reason:** Trade closed/closing; not actionable as new opportunity

#### **5. Missing Entry Anchor or Critical Components (Gate B2 Failure)**
- **Count:** 4 rows
- **Examples:**
  - CVS TRENDPULSE, BAND MATRIX, SIGMASHELL (3 signals): Missing entry_anchor, retracement_level, trendline_break_level
  - SUM.NZ DELTADRIFT, FRACTAL TRACK (2 signals): Missing entry_anchor
- **Reason:** "Not available in dataset — missing entry_anchor or component fields → cannot assess timeliness or define entry range"

#### **6. Directional Conflicts**
- **Count:** 1 row
- **Examples:**
  - META FRACTAL TRACK Monthly Short: Conflicts with META TRENDPULSE Daily Long
- **Reason:** Opposite-direction signals on same asset within near window; conservative policy flags for user awareness

#### **7. Data Integrity Flags**
- **Count:** Multiple rows (noted but not always rejected)
- **Examples:**
  - F-Stack directional assumption violations (T1 < Entry Anchor for Long signals)
  - Support levels above entry anchors for Long signals
  - Negative CAGR differences despite high win rates
- **Action:** Flagged for user awareness; some signals still qualified if other metrics strong

---

## RISK FLAGS & DATA INTEGRITY NOTES

### **1. F-Stack Directional Assumptions**
- **Affected Signals:** WMT Daily FRACTAL TRACK, LULU OSCILLATOR DELTA, several others
- **Issue:** F-Stack 1 targets sometimes below entry anchors for Long signals (or above for Short signals)
- **Interpretation:** May indicate alternative target hierarchies or data entry inconsistencies
- **Action:** Use alternative targets (Historic Rise to Pivot, Avg % Gain) when F-Stack directional conflicts exist

### **2. Support Level Positioning**
- **Affected Signals:** XLU Daily OSCILLATOR DELTA, SJ.TO FRACTAL TRACK
- **Issue:** Support levels positioned above entry anchors for Long signals
- **Interpretation:** May reflect tight consolidation ranges or data anomalies
- **Action:** Use Recent Extrema or Horizontal supports as primary stop-loss levels

### **3. Forward Test vs Historical Win Rate Divergences**
- **Affected Signals:** NFLX FRACTAL TRACK (100% historical vs 53% forward), SFTBY FRACTAL TRACK (100% historical vs 53% forward)
- **Issue:** Significant degradation in recent performance vs historical
- **Action:** Reduced confidence; prefer signals with consistent forward/historical alignment

### **4. Past 6-Month Performance Conflicts**
- **Affected Signals:** NFLX FRACTAL TRACK (0% win rate on 1 trade vs 100% historical)
- **Issue:** Most recent closed trade was a loss despite perfect historical record
- **Action:** Suggests potential regime change or pattern degradation; proceed with caution

### **5. Missing Precomputed R
