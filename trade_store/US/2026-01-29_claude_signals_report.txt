## A) TOP-RANKED QUALIFIED BUNDLES (Synthesized Across All Groups)

### **RANK 1: CVS — Long — confirmations=3** ✓ STRONGEST MULTI-CONFIRMATION

**Bundle Synopsis:**  
Aligned modules: TrendPulse Daily, Band Matrix Daily, SigmaShell Daily  
Intervals: Daily (all)  
Best historical win rate: **100.0%** (SigmaShell)  
Best forward hit rate: **82.89%** (TrendPulse)  
**Timeliness:** 1 passed, 2 late (both waived by R:R ≥3.0×)

**Key Metrics (Best Signal - SigmaShell Daily):**
- **Entry Anchor:** $74.44 (current price as minimum)
- **Current Price:** $74.44
- **T1 (Target):** $116.37
- **Nearest Support:** $70.26
- **R:R to Support:** **10.0×** (reward: $41.93, risk: $4.18)
- **Historical Sharpe:** **1.78** (highest in bundle)
- **CAGR:** **25.69%** vs Buy-Hold 5.11% (+20.58% edge)
- **Win Rate:** **100.0%** (9 trades, 5 years)
- **Forward Hit Rate:** 74.78%
- **6m Closed Win Rate:** 85.95%

**Data Integrity Flags:**
- Band Matrix: Exit signal conflict (shows 2026-01-27 exit @ $72.00 but "No Exit Yet" status)
- SigmaShell: Exit signal today (2026-01-29 @ $74.44) but MTM indicates still open (-0.75%)

**Actionable Next Step:**  
**HOLD** — If still open per MTM, hold above $70.26 support. Target T1 $116.37 or partial at $83.37 (avg historic win level). Stop-loss below $70.26 (risk = $4.18/share from $74.44). Despite exit signal conflicts, R:R remains exceptional.

## B) DIRECTIONAL CONFLICTS (AVOID)

### **EEM — Long vs Short Conflict** ⚠️ ENTIRE BUNDLE EXCLUDED

**Conflicting Signals:**
1. **Long TrendPulse Daily** (2026-01-27, Price: $60.34, Win Rate: 90.91%)
2. **Long TrendPulse Weekly** (2026-01-25, Price: $59.07, Win Rate: 96.15%)
3. **Short DeltaDrift Daily** (2026-01-29, Price: $60.44, Win Rate: 80.0%) **← SAME-DAY**

**Conflict Analysis:**
- Opposite directions overlap within ±0.7% price and 0 days (same current date)
- Short signal is more recent (same-day) and contradicts two Long signals (2 days and 4 days old)
- Per Section 7 Hard Conflict Rule: **Conservative override → AVOID entire bundle**

---

### **META — Long vs Short Conflict** ⚠️ ENTIRE BUNDLE EXCLUDED

**Conflicting Signals:**
1. **Long TrendPulse Daily** (2026-01-27, Price: $672.36, Win Rate: 95.0%)
2. **Short Fractal Track Monthly** (2025-12-03, Price: $647.95, Win Rate: 100.0%, Exit 2026-01-29 @ $738.31, MTM -13.95%)

**Conflict Analysis:**
- Opposite directions within ±14% price and 57 days
- Short signal exited today (2026-01-29) at loss, suggesting reversal
- Per Section 7 Hard Conflict Rule: **Conservative override → AVOID entire bundle**

---

## C) CRITICAL DATA INTEGRITY ISSUES (Synthesized)

### **1. F-Stack Directional Violations (11 Signals)**

**Affected Assets:** WMT, WPM, ASML, GS, QQQ, PPH, TSLA, MSE.PA, SUM.NZ, WPM.TO, IHI

**Issue:** Current price exceeds T1 (Long) or T1 exceeds current price (Short), creating negative or indeterminate R:R calculations.

**Examples:**
- **WMT Daily:** T1 $114.64 < Entry $116.20 (Long) → negative reward
- **PPH Monthly:** Current $105.65 > T1 $100.02 → signal exceeded target
- **TSLA Monthly:** Current $416.56 > T1 $413.68 → signal exceeded target
- **WPM Weekly:** T1 $131.44 < Entry $140.00 (Long) → negative reward

**Impact:** Cannot compute valid progress or R:R; signals flagged as indeterminate or late.

---

### **2. Missing/Ambiguous Nearest Support (18 Signals)**

**Affected Assets:** BRK-B, USO, USDCHF=X, BABA, HDB, ENZL, XLE, EFA, SUM.NZ, IHI

**Issue:** Payload provides multiple support levels (Recent Extrema, Horizontal, F-Stack 1/2, EMA 200) without explicit designation of "nearest" for risk calculation.

**Example (BABA):**
- Recent Extrema: $149.79
- Horizontal: $67.495
- F-Stack 1: $144.416
- EMA 200: $141.24
- **No explicit "nearest" designation → cannot compute R:R deterministically**

**Impact:** Excluded per conservative no-guessing policy.

---

### **3. Exit Signal Conflicts (6 Signals)**

**Issue:** Exit Signal Date/Price provided but trade status shows "No Exit Yet" or MTM indicates still open.

**Examples:**
- **CVS Band Matrix:** Exit 2026-01-27 @ $72.00 but "No Exit Yet" status
- **CVS SigmaShell:** Exit 2026-01-29 @ $74.44 but MTM -0.75% (still open)
- **VGT TrendPulse Monthly:** Exit 2026-01-29 @ $760.80 but listed as open
- **DOL.TO Fractal Track:** Exit 2026-01-27 @ $186.36 but MTM -7.78%

**Impact:** Conflicting status prevents clear actionable recommendation.

---

### **4. Missing Eligibility Field (42 Signals Rejected)**

**Issue:** Payload provides "Win Rate [%], History Tested, Number of Trades" but does not explicitly label as `full_history_win_rate`.

**Examples:**
- MTY.TO: "96.0%, Past 4 years, 25" (would pass if confirmed)
- NVO: "85.71%, Past 10 years, 21" (would pass if confirmed)
- SOXX: "100.0%, Past 24 years, 7" (would pass if confirmed)
- All Group 8 signals (MX.TO, JPY=X, LULU, JETS, SFTBY, NFLX)

**Impact:** Conservative policy requires exact field name or unambiguous mapping; ambiguity triggered policy exclusion for 42 signals.

---

## D) REJECTION SUMMARY BY GATE

**Total Rejected:** 56 signals

### **Gate B2 (Field Completeness) — 18 Rejections**
- Missing T1 (F-Stack 1): EFA (2 signals)

- Missing precomputed anchor/progress/R:R: All Group 8 signals (7)

### **Conservative Eligibility Filter — 42 Rejections**
- Missing/ambiguous `full_history_win_rate` field: MTY.TO, NVO (4 signals), SOXX, BDGI.TO, All Group 8 (7)
- Forward testing <70%: BRK-B Oscillator Delta (63.74%), XLU Oscillator Delta (63.74%)
- Negative MTM + prudential exclusion: MSFT (2 signals), ORCL, IHI (despite passing win-rate threshold)

### **Gate B3 (Duplicates) — 2 Rejections**
- JETS/Short/OSCILLATOR DELTA/Daily (duplicate; kept more recent signal)
- USO/Long/TRENDPULSE/Daily (2 signals, different dates, both late)

### **Directional Conflict (Section 7) — 5 Rejections**
- EEM (3 signals: 2 Long, 1 Short)
- META (2 signals: 1 Long, 1 Short)

### **Lateness (No R:R Waiver) — 11 Rejections**
- SJ.TO (2 signals, R:R 0.15×)
- IWM (R:R 0.08×)
- WPM (2 signals, R:R 0.21×)
- DBC (2 signals, already exited)
- MSE.PA (R:R -0.34×, far exceeded target)

---

## G) RISK FLAGS / DATA INTEGRITY (Button 2)

### **1. Lateness Epidemic**
18 signals are LATE (progress ≥60% or age >7 days). 11 failed R:R waiver threshold (<3.0×).

### **2. F-Stack Directional Violations**
11 signals have T1/anchor ordering conflicts creating negative or indeterminate R:R.

### **3. Exit Signal Conflicts**
6 signals show exit dates but conflicting open-trade status.

### **4. Missing Support Levels**
18 signals have ambiguous nearest support/stop (multiple candidates, no explicit designation).

### **5. Field Naming Ambiguity**
42 signals rejected due to "Win Rate [%], History Tested, Number of Trades" not explicitly labeled as `full_history_win_rate`.

### **6. Zero Avg Holding Period**
Multiple signals report "0 days" for avg holding period in forward testing. Data integrity note: may indicate intraday capture or placeholder value.

### **7. CAGR Underperformance (Select Signals)**
- SJ.TO Fractal Track: Strategy 8.85% vs Buy-Hold 12.31% (-3.46%)
- TSLA TrendPulse: Strategy 26.29% vs Buy-Hold 28.82% (-2.53%)
- AAPL FractalTrack Quarterly: Strategy 12.11% vs Buy-Hold 12.37% (-0.26%)

## I) RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DATA PROVIDER

1. **Add Explicit Precomputed Fields:**
   - `entry_anchor` (single value, not computed from min/max)
   - `lateness_gate` (passed/late/waived/indeterminate)
   - `progress` (% toward T1)
   - `rr_to_nearest_support_stop` (single value)
   - `nearest_support_or_stop` (single level, not band)

2. **Rename Ambiguous Fields:**
   - "Win Rate [%], History Tested, Number of Trades" → separate fields: `full_history_win_rate`, `history_tested_period`, `number_of_trades`

3. **Resolve Exit Signal Conflicts:**
   - If Exit Signal Date/Price exists, mark trade status as "Closed" (not "No Exit Yet")

4. **Fix F-Stack Directional Ordering:**
   - Ensure T1 > Entry Anchor for Long signals
   - Ensure T1 < Entry Anchor for Short signals

5. **Designate Nearest Support:**
   - When multiple support levels exist, explicitly label which is "nearest_support_or_stop" for R:R calculation
