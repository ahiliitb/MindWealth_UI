## KEY INSIGHTS AND CRITICAL FINDINGS

### 1. **SYSTEMATIC QUALITY ISSUES ACROSS GROUPS**

**Critical Filtering Failures Identified:**

- **Sharpe Ratio Failures**: 60-80% of signals across groups failed the 0.75 minimum threshold
  - Group 2: 80% failure rate on Sharpe ratio criterion
  - Group 7: All signals below 0.75 except 4 out of 6
  - Group 8: 5 out of 7 signals failed

- **CAGR Deficiencies**: Multiple signals showed negative CAGR differences vs. buy-and-hold
  - Particularly problematic in Groups 2, 7, and 8
  - Group 8: 5 signals failed the 15% CAGR minimum threshold

- **Signal Staleness**: Majority of signals exceeded acceptable age for their intervals
  - Daily signals 5+ days old (should be <5 days)
  - Weekly signals months old (should be <15 days)
  - Monthly signals 5+ months old (should be <25 days)

- **Late Entry Risk**: Most signals showed 10-40% mark-to-market gains, indicating missed entry opportunities

### 2. **SECTOR AND GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION**

**Strong Performance Areas:**
- **Brazilian Equities** (^BVSP): Exceptional momentum with 95.45% win rates
- **Semiconductors** (SOXX, ASML): Strong but entry timing concerns due to substantial gains already captured
- **Financials** (GS): Perfect 100% win rate with fresh signal
- **Precious Metals** (WPM): Strong performance with timely entries
- **International Markets**: BABA (China), HDB (India), NVO (Denmark) showing strength

**Weak/Problematic Areas:**
- Technology stocks (MSFT, ORCL, AAPL): Showing negative MTM or poor Sharpe ratios
- Healthcare (CVS): Multiple conflicting signals with negative performance
- Emerging Markets (EEM): Contradictory signals from different functions
- Currency Pairs: Generally poor Sharpe ratios and insufficient trade history

### 3. **FUNCTION-SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS**

**TRENDPULSE:**
- Most represented function in qualifying signals
- Best performance on Daily and Quarterly intervals
- Weekly TrendPulse showing mixed results
- **Yearly TrendPulse historically strongest** but limited current signals

**FRACTAL TRACK:**
- Excellent when signals are fresh (BABA, MAR, HDB)
- **CRITICAL ISSUE**: 0% latest performance in Group 8 suggests recent strategy breakdown
- Price distance from Track Level often exceeds 10% threshold
- Long-term signals (Quarterly) showing better quality than short-term

**BAND MATRIX:**
- Strong historical win rates (often 100%)
- Signals frequently too old (months to years)
- Best performance on Weekly interval
- Latest performance varies significantly (82-100%)

**OSCILLATOR DELTA & DELTADRIFT:**
- Good Sharpe ratios when present
- Consistently fail CAGR threshold
- Limited qualifying signals
- Entry timing frequently problematic

**SIGMASHELL:**
- Mixed results - strong when working (CVS 100% win rate)
- Some signals showing catastrophic losses (NVO -46%)
- Function-specific performance highly variable by asset

### 4. **SIGNAL CONFLICTS AND CONTRADICTIONS**

**Major Conflicts Identified:**

- **EEM (Emerging Markets ETF)**: Two LONG signals vs. one SHORT signal (Group 2)
  - Creates directional confusion and reduces confidence
  - Recommendation: AVOID until resolution

- **CVS Health**: Three concurrent LONG signals, all showing negative MTM
  - SigmaShell Daily: -0.75% MTM (exit signal generated)
  - Band Matrix Daily: -4.8% MTM (already exited)
  - TrendPulse Daily: -11.24% MTM
  - Despite multiple confirmations, negative performance suggests market weakness

- **DOL.TO**: Entry signal one day after exit signal from different function
  - Band Matrix entry 01/28 vs. Fractal Track exit 01/27
  - Indicates poor coordination and timing risk

- **VGT**: Daily entry signal while Monthly signal exits same day
  - Conflicting timeframe signals reduce conviction

- **META**: Daily LONG (TrendPulse) vs. Monthly SHORT (Fractal Track, -13.95% MTM)
  - Monthly short reaching exit resolves conflict in favor of daily long
