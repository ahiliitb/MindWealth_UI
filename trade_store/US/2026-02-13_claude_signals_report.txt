- Characteristics: 80-100% win rates, rapid profit-taking cycles, requires active monitoring

### 4. **Critical Risk Management Framework**

**Underwater Positions Requiring Immediate Attention:**

1. **NVO (Novo Nordisk):** -16.59% MTM after 13 days
   - **Action:** EXIT if breaks $47.07 (Recent Extrema support, -5.0% from current)
   - **Context:** 100% historical win rate (14 trades, 44 years) but current drawdown exceeds normal variance
   - **Support:** Critical level at $47.07; already breached F-Stack 1 ($51.10) and EMA 200 ($58.24)

2. **AAPL:** -8.03% MTM after 5 days
   - **Action:** HOLD only if $243.01 Track Level (38.2% Fib) holds; EXIT below
   - **Context:** 93.75% win rate, but negative CAGR alpha (-5.48%); forward-testing 63.64% (lower than backtest)
   - **Support:** Track Level $243.01 critical for signal validity

3. **DIS (Disney):** -6.52% MTM after 13 days
   - **Action:** HOLD with tight stop at $94.09 (F-Stack 1, -10.8%) or EXIT below $90.95
   - **Context:** 80% win rate, but current price below EMA 200; negative alpha (-0.62%)
   - **Support:** F-Stack 1 $94.09 and Recent Extrema $90.95 critical

4. **META:** -3.28% MTM after 5 days
   - **Action:** HOLD with stop below $613.22 Track Level (23.66% Fib, -4.15%)
   - **Context:** 100% win rate (6 trades only, small sample), exceptional Sharpe 8.93, but worst historical MTM -73.01%
   - **Support:** Track Level $613.22 critical

5. **EFN.TO:** -4.4% MTM after 5 days
   - **Action:** EXIT if breaks $33.19 Track Level (-2.04%); current drawdown exceeds historical max loss (-4.16%)
   - **Context:** 85.71% win rate but negative alpha (-4.35%); already breached Recent Extrema and EMA 200
   - **Support:** Track Level $33.19 is final defense

**Stop-Loss Hierarchy (Use in order of proximity):**
1. Track Levels (for FRACTAL TRACK signals) - most critical for signal validity
2. F-Stack 1 Support - primary structural support
3. Recent Extrema - swing low reference
4. EMA 200 - trend support

### 5. **Profit-Taking Opportunities**

**Signals At/Near Targets:**

- **ATZ.TO:** +40.92% MTM, approaching F-Stack 2 target ($119.48, +0.7% away)
  - **Action:** Take 30-50% profit at $119-120, hold remainder for T1 $145.80 (+22.9%)

- **CNQ.TO:** +17.58% MTM, exceeded all near-term targets (T1/T2/T3)
  - **Action:** Take 50% profit at current levels, hold remainder for F-Stack 1 $65.84 (+18.9%)

- **XLU:** +5.2% MTM, at T1 (Historic Rise $45.76, -1.63% from current $46.5)
  - **Action:** Take partial profit; 3 days elapsed vs 24-day avg hold suggests early target achievement

- **ATD.TO Daily:** +1.64% MTM, at T1 ($83.32, -0.6% from current $83.86)
  - **Action:** Take partial profit at T1; next target T2 $85.55 (+2.0%)

- Multiple BYD.TO, CEN.NZ, UPS, C6L.SI, SJ.TO signals exited profitably

### 6. **Contra Indicators & Directional Conflicts**

**Assets with Cross-Signal Complexity (Proceed with Caution):**

- **MAR (Marriott):** Long TrendPulse Weekly (fresh, 0 days) vs Short DeltaDrift Daily (1 day old, 90% win rate)
  - **Context:** Older Long already exited at profit; new Short may signal reversal
  - **Action:** AVOID fresh Long entries; monitor Short for confirmation

- **UPS:** Long TrendPulse Daily (exited 2026-02-13 at profit) vs Short DeltaDrift (2026-02-09, no exit yet)
  - **Context:** Long exit reinforces Short signal, but Short shows negative alpha (-0.35%)
  - **Action:** AVOID both directions until technical clarity emerges

- **C6L.SI (Singapore Airlines):** Long TrendPulse Daily (exited 2026-02-11) vs Short Fractal Track Monthly (exited 2026-02-13)
  - **Context:** Both positions closed; indicates high volatility and directional uncertainty
  - **Action:** AVOID until new signal emerges

**Recent Exits as Contra Indicators:**

- **CNR.TO:** Daily exit 2026-02-13 (same day as Weekly Long confirmation) suggests profit-taking pressure
- **MEL.NZ:** Daily exit 2026-02-12 (one day before Weekly Long confirmation) reduces Daily confidence
- **SJ.TO:** Two Monthly Fractal Track exits 2026-02-13 despite fresh Weekly Long suggest target proximity

### 7. **Forward-Testing Validation Highlights**

**Functions with Strong Forward-Testing Performance:**

- **TrendPulse Daily:** 82.2% win rate / 528 trades / 1.4-month avg hold
- **TrendPulse Weekly:** 80.3% win rate / 269 trades / 3.6-month avg hold

- **BaselineDivergence:** 73.68% (Weekly)
- **DeltaDrift:** 83.85% (Daily)
- **Fractal Track:** 93.09% (Daily), 92.68% (Monthly)

### 8. **Valuation Context (Where Available)**

**Attractive Valuations Supporting Technical Setups:**

- **AMD:** PEG 0.52 (undervalued relative to growth), P/E 78.83
- **TSM:** PEG 0.65, P/E 33.93 (reasonable for semiconductor leader)
- **AAPL:** PEG 2.95, P/E 41.91 (premium but justified by ecosystem strength)
- **GS:** P/E 17.94 (attractive for financial services)

**Elevated Valuations Requiring Monitoring:**

- **WMT:** PEG 4.86, P/E 46.65 (high valuation, negative alpha concern)
- **NVDA:** P/E 50.93 (elevated but AI leadership premium)

**Valuation Concerns:**

- **CNU.NZ:** P/E 913.0 (extreme; proceed with caution despite 81.25% technical win rate)
- **FSF.NZ:** P/E Infinity (no earnings; speculative)
