## Key Recommendations

1. **Semiconductor sector focus** - The strongest signals in our analysis come from the semiconductor industry (TSM, ASML), suggesting this sector offers particularly compelling opportunities.

2. **Balance long and short exposure** - While most signals are bullish, including the UBER and NFLX short positions provides hedging against potential market weakness.

3. **Staggered entry approach** - For signals that have already moved slightly (like PFE), consider partial positions with plans to add on any pullbacks.

4. **Defined risk management** - Each signal has clear stop-loss levels based on technical support/resistance, which should be strictly followed to manage risk.

5. **Target-based exit strategy** - Rather than using time-based exits, plan to exit positions as they reach their technical targets, starting with partial profit-taking at the first target level.

6. **Sector diversification** - The filtered signals provide exposure across technology, energy, healthcare, travel, and fixed income, creating a naturally diversified portfolio.

7. **Timeframe diversification** - The mix of daily, weekly, and quarterly signals allows for balancing short-term opportunities with longer-term trends.
