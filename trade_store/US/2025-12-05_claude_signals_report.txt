## Key Recommendations

1. **Balanced portfolio construction** - Consider allocating capital across both long and short opportunities to reduce overall market exposure while capturing specific trends.

2. **Tiered position sizing** - Allocate larger positions to signals with the highest win rates and CAGR differentials (NFLX short, SLV long, MCD long).

3. **Sector rotation awareness** - The signals highlight strength in consumer services, precious metals, and select technology names, while suggesting weakness in streaming media.

4. **Risk management discipline** - Implement the recommended stop-loss levels for each position to manage downside risk, particularly for the more volatile names.

5. **Target-based profit taking** - Consider scaling out of positions as they reach their identified target levels rather than exiting all at once.

6. **Timeframe alignment** - For longer-term portfolios, prioritize the monthly signals (KWEB, NFLX); for shorter-term traders, focus on the daily signals (COIN, WIPRO.NS, LYFT, CVS, SLV).

7. **Confirmation monitoring** - Watch for additional confirmations from other technical indicators or fundamental developments to increase conviction in these signals.
