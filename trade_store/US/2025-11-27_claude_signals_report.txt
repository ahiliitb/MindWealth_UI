## Investment Strategy Recommendations

1. **Portfolio Allocation Strategy**: Allocate capital across these signals with emphasis on those with multiple function confirmations (MSFT, IBKR, FSF.NZ, UBER, GDX) as these provide the highest conviction opportunities.

2. **Sector Weighting**: Maintain a balanced approach with core positions in technology (MSFT, IBKR, UBER), market indices (^GSPC, ^NDX), international exposure (FSF.NZ, KWEB), and precious metals (GDX) for diversification.

3. **Position Sizing**: Consider larger allocations to signals with perfect historical win rates (FSF.NZ, ^GSPC, ^NDX, UBER, KWEB) and positive CAGR differentials (^GSPC, GDX, KWEB).

4. **Risk Management**: Implement the recommended stop-loss levels for each position to limit downside risk. Consider scaling into positions that have already begun moving in the predicted direction.

5. **Target Management**: Establish a plan for partial profit-taking at the first target levels, with trailing stops for the remainder to capture potential extended moves to higher targets.

6. **Monitoring Schedule**: Given the daily timeframe of these signals, implement a daily monitoring routine to track progress and manage risk appropriately.

7. **Correlation Awareness**: Be mindful that several signals (particularly the tech-related ones and market indices) may exhibit correlation during market stress events, potentially increasing portfolio volatility.

These carefully filtered signals represent the highest probability trading opportunities based on multiple technical criteria, historical performance, and timeliness considerations. The balanced mix of sectors, regions, and technical confirmations provides a robust foundation for potential outperformance.
