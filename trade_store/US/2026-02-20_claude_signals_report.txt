# COMPREHENSIVE FILTERED SIGNALS SYNTHESIS

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

After processing 8 parallel result sets encompassing diverse asset classes, timeframes, and quantitative functions, I have synthesized a unified ranking of the highest-conviction trading opportunities. The analysis filtered **81 total signals** across **47 unique assets**, applying rigorous multi-gate criteria emphasizing:

- **Historical win rates ≥70%** (Tier A requirement)
- **Confirmed signal status** (no unconfirmed entries)
- **Timeliness** (signals not late/at-target unless exceptional RR waives)
- **Structural integrity** (no directional ordering conflicts)
- **Forward-testing validation** (real-world performance beyond backtests)

**Key Finding:** Multi-confirmation opportunities (same asset, multiple functions/timeframes) demonstrate the highest conviction, with **AMD, TSM, MAR, USCI, BTI, ENZL, CNR.TO, and DBC** showing 2-3 confirming signals each.

## KEY INSIGHTS AND STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. **Multi-Confirmation Dominance: Highest Conviction Clusters**

**AMD (Semiconductors)** leads with 2 confirmations across timeframes:
- **Weekly FRACTAL TRACK** (2026-02-20): 83.33% win rate, fresh signal (0 days), +8.6% progress vs track level
- **Monthly TRENDPULSE** (2025-07-31): 87.5% win rate, 6.8 months elapsed, +12.09% MTM, within avg 10.8-month hold

**Insight:** AMD's dual confirmation (short-term Weekly + intermediate Monthly) creates a high-conviction long opportunity. The Monthly signal's +12.09% MTM over 6.8 months validates momentum, while the fresh Weekly signal provides a tactical re-entry point. However, **contra-indicator present:** Daily Short (FRACTAL TRACK, 2026-02-19, +1.58% MTM) reduces authorization confidence for fresh Daily entries—Weekly/Monthly timeframes are distinct and preferred.

**TSM (Taiwan Semiconductor)** shows exceptional dual Monthly + Weekly TRENDPULSE alignment:
- **Weekly** (2026-02-20): 100% win rate (19 trades), fresh signal, 0% progress
- **Monthly** (2026-01-31): 100% win rate (21 trades), 20 days elapsed, +12.09% MTM

**Insight:** Both signals have perfect 100% historical win rates, creating extraordinary statistical confidence. However, **negative CAGR alpha** (Weekly: -1.69%, Monthly: -1.42%) indicates these signals capture short-term momentum rather than long-term outperformance vs buy-and-hold. Recommended as **tactical swing trades** (3.6-month avg hold for Weekly, 9.3-month for Monthly) rather than strategic positions.

**Precious Metals Sector (GLD, SLV, WPM)** demonstrates coordinated strength:
- **GLD:** 100% win rate, exceptional Sharpe 2.41, +14.27% CAGR alpha
- **SLV:** 93.33% win rate, Sharpe 1.56, +12.62% CAGR alpha (already at T1, profit-taking mode)
- **WPM:** 100% win rate, Sharpe 1.92, **highest CAGR alpha +16.6%**

**Insight:** All three signals triggered on 2026-02-19 (1 day old), suggesting sector-wide breakout. WPM offers the strongest risk-adjusted return profile. **Risk:** Sector concentration—if metals reverse, all three positions correlate. Diversify with non-commodity positions.

---

### 2. **Geographic and Asset Class Diversification**

**North America Dominance (16 signals):** US equities (AMD, ETH-USD, GLD, SLV, WPM, GOOG, NVDA, XLU, MAR, DBC, PG), Canadian equities (CNR.TO, MX.TO, ATZ.TO, TRI.TO, NA.TO)

**International Exposure (5 signals):** New Zealand (ENZL, MEL.NZ, IFT.NZ, FPH.NZ, SUM.NZ), UK (BTI), Singapore (C6L.SI), Brazil (^BVSP), China (ASHR, KWEB)

**Asset Classes:** Equities (20), ETFs/Indices (5), Commodities (2: USCI, DBC), Crypto (1: ETH-USD), Forex (2: JPY=X, GBPUSD=X)

**Recommendation:** Diversify across geographies and asset classes to reduce correlation risk. Precious metals (GLD/SLV/WPM) + international equities (ENZL, BTI, TSM) + US defensives (XLU, PG) + crypto (ETH-USD) provides balanced exposure.

---

### 3. **Timeliness and Entry Timing: Fresh vs Mature Signals**

**Fresh Signals (≤5 days elapsed, optimal entry timing):**
- AMD Weekly (0 days), TSM Weekly (0 days), ETH-USD (0 days), BTI Daily (0-1 days), ENZL Daily (0-1 days), CNR.TO Weekly (0-5 days), DBC Daily (1 day), GOOG (1 day), GLD/SLV/WPM (1 day), PG Weekly (5 days), MX.TO/ATZ.TO/GNE.NZ (5 days)

**Mature Signals (≥6 months, approaching avg hold period):**
- AMD Monthly (6.8 months, avg 10.8), XLU FRACTAL TRACK (3.6 months, avg 9.8), ATZ.TO (4.8 months, avg 6.4, **profit-taking zone**)

**Recommendation:** Prioritize fresh signals (0-5 days) for new entries. Mature signals (AMD Monthly, XLU FRACTAL TRACK) are suitable for **holding existing positions** with trailing stops, not fresh entries. ATZ.TO (+51.16% MTM, 4.8 months) is in **profit-taking mode**—take partial profits and trail stop.

---

### 4. **Risk-Reward Profiles: Identifying Asymmetric Opportunities**

**Highest RR Ratios (computed where inputs available):**
- **MEL.NZ Weekly:** ~4.9:1 to T1 (stop $5.46, target $6.35, current $5.61)
- **RELIANCE.NS:** ~3.06:1 to T1 (stop $1386.1, target $1524.01, current $1419.4)
- **SONY:** ~2.98:1 to T2, ~9.45:1 to Function Target (stop $21.82, targets $25.36/$31.12, current $21.93)

**Poorest RR Ratios (profit-taking mode):**
- **ATZ.TO:** 0.41:1 to primary target (already exceeded intermediate targets, 51.16% MTM)
- **SLV:** Already at T1 ($76.30), current $76.62 (profit-taking mode)
- **BDGI.TO:** 0.16:1 to T1 (late, 79% progress)

**Recommendation:** Focus new entries on high-RR opportunities (MEL.NZ, RELIANCE.NS, SONY). Avoid chasing late signals (ATZ.TO, SLV, BDGI.TO)—these are profit-taking candidates, not fresh entries.

---

### 5. **Forward-Testing Validation: Real-World Performance Beyond Backtests**

**Strongest Forward-Testing Metrics:**
- **DELTADRIFT (Daily):** 90.36% win rate (83 trades, 2.3-month avg hold) for NFLX/KXS.TO; 77.16% (394 trades, 15 days) for ABNB/IHI
- **TRENDPULSE (Daily):** 82.2% win rate (528 trades, 1.4-month avg hold)
- **BASELINEDIVERGENCE (Weekly):** 68.44% win rate (564 trades, 3.3-month avg hold) for NVDA

**Latest 6-Month Performance (most recent real-world validation):**
- **TRENDPULSE:** 91.56-95.89% across 73-304 trades
- **FRACTAL TRACK:** 92.68-94.52% across 41-304 trades
- **DELTADRIFT:** 72.73-84.38% across 11-130 trades

**Recommendation:** Signals with strong forward-testing (DELTADRIFT, TRENDPULSE) and recent 6-month performance (90%+ win rates) demonstrate robust out-of-sample validation. Prioritize these over signals with weak forward-testing (e.g., TRI.TO Short: 0.0% forward win rate despite 87.5% backtest).

---

### 6. **Sector Rotation and Thematic Opportunities**

**Semiconductors (AMD, TSM, NVDA, VGT, SOXX):** Multiple confirmations suggest sector-wide momentum. NVDA's 83.7% win rate + +29.56% CAGR alpha + fresh Baseline Divergence signal (5 days) offers tactical entry.

**Precious Metals (GLD, SLV, WPM):** Coordinated 1-day-old signals with 93-100% win rates and +12-16% CAGR alpha indicate sector breakout. WPM's +16.6% CAGR alpha is highest in dataset.

**Utilities (XLU):** Triple Daily confirmation (TrendPulse, Oscillator Delta, Fractal Track) with 85-100% win rates. However, **all three signals have triggered EXIT on 2026-02-18/19/20**—profit-taking mode, not fresh entry opportunity.

**Consumer Staples (PG):** Weekly TrendPulse (100% win rate, +2.06% CAGR alpha, 5 days old) offers defensive exposure. Multiple Daily exits (2026-02-17/19) create contra-indicator for Daily entries—Weekly signal is distinct and preferred.

**Recommendation:** Rotate into semiconductors (AMD, TSM, NVDA) and precious metals (GLD, WPM) for growth; add consumer staples (PG) and utilities (XLU, if re-entry after exit consolidation) for defense.

---

### 7. **Contra-Indicators and Exit Signals: Risk Management Discipline**

**Active Contra-Indicators (reduce authorization confidence):**
- **AMD:** Daily Short (FRACTAL TRACK, 2026-02-19) affects Daily Long entries; Weekly/Monthly Longs unaffected
- **MAR:** DeltaDrift Daily Short exit (2026-02-20, +2.01% MTM) occurred same day as TrendPulse Daily/Weekly Long signals—monitor for $347-356 consolidation
- **PG:** Multiple Daily TrendPulse exits (2026-02-17/19) affect Daily entries; Weekly signal (2026-02-15) unaffected
- **SJ.TO:** FRACTAL TRACK Monthly exit (2026-02-20, +22.6-24.35% MTM) affects Monthly entries; Weekly TrendPulse (2026-02-15) treated as reinforcement

**Exit Signals Triggered (profit-taking mode, not fresh entries):**
- **XLU:** All 3 Daily signals exited 2026-02-18/19/20 (TrendPulse +3.19%, Oscillator Delta +6.42%, FRACTAL TRACK +4.29%)
- **EFA:** Weekly TrendPulse exit 2026-02-20 (+4.93% MTM, 26 days)
- **KWEB:** Monthly FRACTAL TRACK Short exit 2026-02-20 (+3.96% MTM, 1.7 months)
- **NA.TO:** Daily FRACTAL TRACK exit 2026-02-20 (+10.14% MTM, 21 days, exceptional 24.66% CAGR, 7.0 Sharpe)

**Recommendation:** Respect exit signals—these are model-based profit-taking suggestions. Do not re-enter until price consolidates and new signal triggers. Contra-indicators (AMD Daily Short, MAR DeltaDrift Short exit) warrant caution but do not mechanically contradict different-timeframe signals.

---

### 8. **CAGR Alpha and Strategy Outperformance: Long-Term Value**

**Highest Positive CAGR Alpha (strategy >> buy-and-hold):**
- **WPM:** +16.6% (100% win rate, Sharpe 1.92)
- **ENZL FRACTAL TRACK:** +14.57% (100% win rate, Sharpe 0.51)
- **GLD:** +14.27% (100% win rate, Sharpe 2.41)
- **AMD Monthly TRENDPULSE:** +14.63% (87.5% win rate, Sharpe 1.29)
- **XLU FRACTAL TRACK:** +13.13% (100% win rate, Sharpe 2.44)

**Negative CAGR Alpha (strategy < buy-and-hold, caution warranted):**
- **TSM Weekly/Monthly:** -1.69% / -1.42% (100% win rates but underperform buy-and-hold)
- **TSLA:** -18.0% (73.33% win rate but severe underperformance)
- **MTY.TO:** -4.15% (79.17% win rate but underperforms)
- **ATD.TO:** -3.66% (90% win rate but underperforms)

**Recommendation:** Prioritize signals with **positive CAGR alpha** (WPM, ENZL, GLD, AMD Monthly, XLU) for long-term strategic positions. Signals with **negative alpha** (TSM, TSLA, MTY.TO) are suitable for **short-term tactical trades** only (respect avg holding periods, exit on signals). Negative alpha + high win rate suggests strategy captures short-term momentum but not long-term drift.

## FINAL RANKED TOP 10 BUNDLES (CROSS-SYNTHESIS)

### **1. AMD — Long — confirmations=2 (Weekly FRACTAL TRACK + Monthly TRENDPULSE)**

**Why #1:**
- Multi-timeframe confirmation (Weekly + Monthly)
- Weekly: 83.33% win rate, fresh (0 days), +8.6% above track, RR ~10.6× to T1
- Monthly: 87.5% win rate, +12.09% MTM (6.8 months), +14.63% CAGR alpha, within avg 10.8-month hold
- Forward testing: 63.64-73.02% win rates, 95.89% latest 6-month performance

**Actionable:** HOLD/ADD Weekly near $200.15-202.15 (entry anchor), stop below $194.27 (F-Track 1), target $262.34 (T1, +31%). HOLD Monthly existing positions (+12.09% MTM), partial profit near $206.9 (Function Target, +3.4%), trail stop to $170.08.

**Contra-indicator:** Daily Short (FRACTAL TRACK, 2026-02-19, +1.58% MTM) affects Daily entries only; Weekly/Monthly unaffected.

---

### **2. TSM — Long — confirmations=2 (Weekly TRENDPULSE + Monthly TRENDPULSE)**

**Why #2:**
- Dual TRENDPULSE confirmation (Weekly + Monthly), both 100% win rates (19 trades Weekly, 21 trades Monthly)
- Weekly: Fresh (0 days), 0% progress, Sharpe 1.65
- Monthly: 20 days elapsed, +12.09% MTM, Sharpe 1.28
- Forward testing: 73.02-80.3% win rates, 91.56-95.89% latest 6-month performance

**Caution:** Negative CAGR alpha (Weekly -1.69%, Monthly -1.42%)—signals capture short-term momentum, not long-term outperformance. Treat as **tactical swing trades** (3.6-9.3 month avg hold), not strategic positions.

**Actionable:** HOLD/ADD Weekly near $361.87 (entry anchor), stop below $275.06 (Recent Extrema) or $291.05 (F-Stack 1), target $427.83 (T1, +15.5%). HOLD Monthly (+12.09% MTM), partial profit near $441.46 (T1, +19.1%), trail stop to $274.03 (F-Stack 1).

**Reinforcement:** EXIT_SHORT (DeltaDrift Monthly, 2026-02-20, -21.93% loss) reduces overlap risk for new LONG entries.

---

### **3. Precious Metals Basket (GLD, WPM, SLV) — Long — confirmations=3 (all Daily FRACTAL TRACK, 2026-02-19)**

**Why #3:**
- Sector-wide coordinated breakout (all 1 day old)
- **WPM:** 100% win rate, Sharpe 1.92, **+16.6% CAGR alpha (highest in dataset)**, 11.84% above track
- **GLD:** 100% win rate, Sharpe 2.41, +14.27% CAGR alpha, 5.31% above track
- **SLV:** 93.33% win rate, Sharpe 1.56, +12.62% CAGR alpha, 19.52% above track (**already at T1, profit-taking mode**)

**Actionable:**
- **WPM (preferred):** HOLD/ADD near $143.50 (entry anchor), stop below $130.9 (Recent Extrema, 8.7% risk), target $155.11 (T1, +3.1%), extended $186.01 (+23.7%)
- **GLD:** HOLD/ADD near $457.34 (entry anchor), stop below $427.13 (Recent Extrema, 6.4% risk), target $494.72 (T1, +5.6%), extended $623.7 (+33.4%)
- **SLV:** HOLD existing positions (already +7.9% MTM, at T1 $76.30), take partial profit or trail stop to $66.37 (Recent Extrema), next target $78.76 (T2, +2.8%)

**Risk:** Sector concentration—all three correlate. Diversify with non-commodity positions.

---

### **4. USCI — Long — confirmations=2 (Daily TRENDPULSE + Daily FRACTAL TRACK)**

**Why #4:**
- Multi-function confirmation (TRENDPULSE + FRACTAL TRACK, both Daily, both 2026-02-19)
- TRENDPULSE: 100% win rate (14 trades), Sharpe 1.78, but negative CAGR alpha -2.01%
- FRACTAL TRACK: 94.44% win rate (18 trades), Sharpe 1.7, **+8.95% CAGR alpha** (superior)
- Both signals 1 day old, 0.34% above entry

**Actionable:** HOLD/ADD near $82.05 (entry anchor), stop below $79.86 (Recent Extrema, 2.6% risk). FRACTAL TRACK preferred for CAGR alpha—target $87.87 (T1, +5.9%), extended $105.3 (+26.5%). TRENDPULSE target $84.64 (Avg Gain, +2.0%).

---

### **5. MAR (Marriott) — Long — confirmations=2 (Daily TRENDPULSE + Weekly TRENDPULSE)**

**Why #5:**
- Multi-timeframe confirmation (Daily + Weekly TRENDPULSE)
- Daily: 100% win rate (18 trades), Sharpe 1.88, +11.59% CAGR alpha, 2 days old but -2.27% below entry (minor pullback)
- Weekly: 85.71% win rate (28 trades), Sharpe 0.65, +0.87% CAGR alpha, 5 days old, -1.68% below entry

**Caution:** **Contra-indicator**—DeltaDrift Daily Short exit (2026-02-20, +2.01% MTM, 8 days) occurred same day as Daily/Weekly Long signals. Not a mechanical contradiction (different function), but suggests $347-356 consolidation zone. Monitor for stabilization above $350 before adding.

**Actionable:** HOLD/ADD Daily near $347-350 (current $347.93 is 2.27% below entry anchor $355.53), stop below $312.07 (Recent Extrema, 10.3% risk), target $387.29 (T1, +11.3%). Weekly: HOLD existing, ADD cautiously on dips to $340-345, stop $312 zone or $281 (EMA 200), target $405.81 (T1, +16.6%).

---

### **6. BTI (British American Tobacco) — Long — confirmations=2 (Daily TRENDPULSE + Daily FRACTAL TRACK)**

**Why #6:**
- Dual Daily confirmation (TRENDPULSE + FRACTAL TRACK, 0-1 day old)
- TRENDPULSE: 100% win rate (13 trades), **+6.89% CAGR alpha**, Sharpe 0.97, very short avg hold (10 days)
- FRACTAL TRACK: 100% win rate (12 trades), +5.19% CAGR alpha, Sharpe 1.67, longer avg hold (1.2 years)

**Caution:** **Contra-indicator**—Weekly TRENDPULSE EXIT (2026-02-20, +8.46% MTM, 6.5 months) occurred same day as Daily TRENDPULSE entry. Suggests longer-term trend exhaustion; treat Daily signals as **short-term tactical trades** (10-day avg hold for TRENDPULSE).

**Actionable:**
- **Daily TRENDPULSE:** HOLD/ADD near $61.93 (entry anchor), tight stop below $58.87 (Recent Extrema, 5.2% risk), target $67.72 (T1, +9.1%). Avg hold 10 days—exit quickly.
- **Daily FRACTAL TRACK:** HOLD/ADD near $59.03 (entry anchor) or track level $59.31, stop below $58.87 or $52.44 (F-Stack 1), target $65.92 (T1, +6.2%). Longer avg hold (1.2 years)—more patient.

---

### **7. ENZL (iShares MSCI New Zealand) — Long — confirmations=2 (Daily TRENDPULSE + Daily FRACTAL TRACK)**

**Why #7:**
- Dual Daily confirmation (TRENDPULSE + FRACTAL TRACK, 0-1 day old)
- TRENDPULSE: 88.24% win rate (17 trades), but negative CAGR alpha -2.15%, low Sharpe 0.15
- FRACTAL TRACK: 100% win rate (12 trades), **+14.57% CAGR alpha** (exceptional), Sharpe 0.51

**Recommendation:** FRACTAL TRACK signal is superior (positive alpha, 100% win rate). TRENDPULSE has negative alpha—pair with FRACTAL TRACK for confirmation only.

**Actionable:**
- **Daily FRACTAL TRACK (preferred):** HOLD/ADD near $45.78 (entry anchor) or track level $44.68, stop below $44.90 (Recent Extrema, 2.0% risk) or $44.68 (track level, 2.5% risk), target $50.11 (T2, +9.3%), extended $51.60 (+12.6%). Avg hold 5.1 months.
- **Daily TRENDPULSE:** HOLD/ADD with caution near $45.29 (entry anchor), very tight stop below $44.90 or $45.72 (EMA 200), target $46.16 (T1, +0.7%, very close). Use FRACTAL TRACK as primary signal.

---

### **8. CNR.TO (Canadian National Railway) — Long — confirmations=2 (dual Weekly TRENDPULSE, 2026-02-20 + 2026-02-15)**

**Why #8:**
- Dual Weekly TRENDPULSE confirmation (2 signals 5 days apart)
- Both: 88% win rate (25 trades), Sharpe 1.1, +1.56% CAGR alpha

- Second signal (2026-02-20): Fresh (0 days), 0% progress

**Actionable:**
- **2026-02-20 signal (preferred for fresh entry):** HOLD/ADD near $146.74 (entry anchor), stop below $136.36 (EMA 200, 9.8% risk) or $130.99 (Recent Extrema, 13.4% risk), target $160.61 (T1, +6.2%)
- **2026-02-15 signal (existing positions):** HOLD (+3.26% MTM), approaching T1 $155.54 (+2.9%), trail stop to $136.98 (F-Stack 1) or $136.09 (EMA 200)

---

### **9. DBC (PowerShares DB Commodity Index) — Long — confirmations=2 (Daily TRENDPULSE + Daily FRACTAL TRACK)**

**Why #9:**
- Dual Daily confirmation (TRENDPULSE + FRACTAL TRACK, both 1 day old)
- TRENDPULSE: 76.47% win rate (17 trades), slight negative CAGR alpha -0.48%, Sharpe 0.25
- FRACTAL TRACK: 100% win rate (18 trades), +0.8% CAGR alpha, Sharpe 1.7

**Recommendation:** FRACTAL TRACK signal is superior (100% win rate, positive alpha). TRENDPULSE has negative alpha—pair with FRACTAL TRACK for confirmation only.

**Actionable:**
- **Daily FRACTAL TRACK (preferred):** HOLD/ADD near $24.29 (entry anchor), stop below $23.59 (Recent Extrema, 4.1% risk), target $25.12 (T1, +2.1%), extended $26.12 (+6.2%). Avg hold very short (25 days for TRENDPULSE, likely similar for FRACTAL TRACK).
- **Daily TRENDPULSE:** HOLD/ADD near $24.29, same stop/targets. Use FRACTAL TRACK as primary signal.

---

### **10. GOOG (Alphabet) — Long — confirmations=1 (Daily FRACTAL TRACK)**

**Why #10:**
- Single-function confirmation, but strong metrics: 91.67% win rate (12 trades), +2.73% CAGR alpha, Sharpe 1.63
- 1 day old, +3.74% MTM (favorable early move)
- Track level $301.06 (23.66%), current 4.6% above track

**Actionable:** HOLD/ADD near $302.52 (entry anchor), tight stop below $302.82 (Recent Extrema, 0.1% risk, very tight) or $285.48 (F-Stack 1, 5.5% risk), target $333.92 (T2, +6.2%), extended $428.05 (+36.1%). Avg hold 5.4 months.

---

### **2. Negative CAGR Alpha (Policy Exclusion for Strategic Positions)**

- **TSLA Weekly FRACTAL TRACK:** 73.33% win rate but **-18.0% CAGR alpha** (severe underperformance vs buy-and-hold)—suitable for **short-term tactical trade only** (avg hold 15 months), not strategic position
- **NFLX Weekly DELTADRIFT:** 80% win rate but **-15.88% CAGR alpha**, Sharpe -0.03—recent EXIT_SHORT (Quarterly, +16.09% MTM) reinforces long, but negative alpha warrants caution
- **KXS.TO Weekly DELTADRIFT:** 100% win rate but **-3.1% CAGR alpha**, exceptional Sharpe 14.45—short-term tactical trade only (2.7-month avg hold)
- **MTY.TO Weekly TRENDPULSE:** 79.17% win rate but **-4.15% CAGR alpha**, EXIT signal triggered 2026-02-20 (+6.97% MTM)—**EXIT per model output**
- **^BVSP Monthly TRENDPULSE:** 90% win rate but **-1.73% CAGR alpha**—selective timing opportunity despite negative alpha, but monitor closely

### **3. Adverse MTM / Directional Integrity Concerns**

- **NVO:** 100% win rate but **-20.21% MTM** (severe adverse movement since entry)—excluded from Tier A pending stabilization
- **DIS Monthly FRACTAL TRACK:** 80% win rate but **-6.4% MTM** (20 days), negative CAGR alpha -0.62%—HOLD FOR REVIEW, monitor for stabilization above $105.58
- **GBPUSD=X Monthly FRACTAL TRACK:** 83.33% win rate but **-2.35% MTM** (20 days), limited trade history (6 trades)—HOLD FOR REVIEW, forex volatility
- **NZDCAD=X Monthly FRACTAL TRACK:** 76.92% win rate but **-0.31% MTM**, low CAGR alpha +0.75%—HOLD FOR REVIEW
- **C6L.SI Monthly FRACTAL TRACK Short:** 92.86% win rate but **-7.81% MTM** (adverse; price rose instead of fell)—HOLD existing positions with stop above track level $7.5813, not fresh entry
- **TD.TO Monthly TRENDPULSE Short:** 100% win rate but **-12.87% MTM** (adverse; price rose instead of fell)—excluded from Tier A

### **4. Contra-Indicators / Recent Exits**

- **ACWX Monthly TRENDPULSE:** Recent FRACTAL TRACK EXIT_LONG (2026-02-20, +21.63% MTM, 7.8 months)—reduces authorization confidence for fresh TRENDPULSE entry
- **GS Monthly TRENDPULSE:** Recent TRENDPULSE EXIT_LONG (2026-02-20, +23.75% MTM, 5.8 months, older Aug 2025 signal)—reduces authorization confidence for fresh Jan 2026 entry
- **PG Daily TRENDPULSE (multiple):** Recent EXIT_LONG (2026-02-17/19)—affects Daily entries; Weekly signal (2026-02-15) unaffected
- **SUM.NZ Daily DELTADRIFT:** Recent EXIT_LONG (2026-02-17, -7.02% MTM, 7 days)—new signal (2026-02-19) has contra-indicator, monitor for re-validation

---

### **5. Forward-Testing Weakness**

- **TRI.TO Monthly TRENDPULSE Short:** 87.5% historical win rate but **0.0% forward-testing win rate** (0 wins out of 7 trades)—despite +24.23% MTM in 20 days, forward-testing failure is a red flag. **HOLD existing positions with trailing stop, take partial profits; not recommended as fresh entry.**

## RISK / INTEGRITY NOTES

### **Model-Output Integrity Issues:**

1. **Directional Ordering Conflicts (Gate A5):**
   - **SBUX Daily FRACTAL TRACK:** T1 $95.37 is below today's price $97.49 for a Long signal (conflict)—ignore T1, use T2 $105.99 as first valid target
   - **MFT.NZ Daily FRACTAL TRACK:** T1 $61.98 is below today's price $64.3 for a Long signal (conflict)—ignore T1, use T2 $65.38 as first valid target
   - **CNU.NZ Daily FRACTAL TRACK:** T1 $9.17 is below today's price $9.51 for a Long signal (conflict)—excluded from Tier A due to integrity conflict + recent DeltaDrift exit

2. **Missing Dependencies (all rows):**
   - **rr_to_nearest_support_stop:** Not available in model output for any row. Risk-reward ratios computed manually only where all required inputs (entry, stop, target) were present in payload; otherwise stated as "not available in model output."

3. **Exit Signal Timing:**
   - **UPS Daily DELTADRIFT Short:** EXIT signal triggered 2026-02-17 at $115.51, but payload shows position still open with current price $116.73 (1.06% above exit price). Possible interpretation: exit signal was a "take-profit suggestion" not executed, position remains open. Treat with caution—model recommended exit 3 days ago.

### **Contra Indicator Summary:**

- **AMD:** Daily Short (FRACTAL TRACK, 2026-02-19, +1.58% MTM, 85% win rate, +15.14% CAGR alpha) affects Daily entries; Weekly/Monthly unaffected
- **MAR:** DeltaDrift Daily Short exit (2026-02-20, +2.01% MTM, 8 days, 90% win rate, +3.76% CAGR alpha) occurred same day as TrendPulse Daily/Weekly Long signals—monitor $347-356 consolidation
- **PG:** Multiple Daily TrendPulse exits (2026-02-17/19, 88% win rate, +6.2% CAGR alpha) affect Daily entries; Weekly signal (2026-02-15) unaffected
- **BTI:** Weekly TrendPulse exit (2026-02-20, +8.46% MTM, 6.5 months, 95.65% win rate, -2.78% CAGR alpha) occurred same day as Daily TrendPulse entry—suggests longer-term trend exhaustion; treat Daily signals as short-term tactical trades
- **SJ.TO:** FRACTAL TRACK Monthly exit (2026-02-20, +22.6-24.35% MTM, 3.7-7.8 months, 100% win rate, -4.02% CAGR alpha) affects Monthly entries; Weekly TrendPulse (2026-02-15) treated as reinforcement (prior long closed profitably)
- **SUM.NZ:** DeltaDrift Daily exit (2026-02-17, -7.02% MTM, 7 days, 71.43% win rate, +6.0% CAGR alpha) affects fresh Daily entry (2026-02-19)—monitor for re-validation
