# COMPREHENSIVE FILTERED SIGNALS SYNTHESIS

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

After comprehensive analysis across 8 parallel processing groups, **no signals qualify for Tier A approval** under the strict risk management criteria applied. The synthesis reveals a challenging market environment where most signals exhibit one or more disqualifying characteristics: significant lateness (price has progressed 10-40%+ since signal dates), profit-taking proximity (at/near targets), directional conflicts, negative CAGR alpha, or adverse price movement. The filtered universe represents opportunities that passed initial screening but require careful review before capital deployment.

## SYNTHESIS FINDINGS

### 1. CRITICAL MARKET CONTEXT (as of 2026-02-27)

**No Tier A Approvals:** After rigorous gate analysis, **zero signals meet all Tier A approval criteria**. This represents an unusually challenging market environment where:

- **Profit-taking dominance:** 15+ signals have exceeded first/second targets (MCD, WMT, XLU, ATZ.TO, GDX, MAR, PPH, ACWX, DOL.TO Monthly)
- **Exit signals active:** 12+ signals triggered exits on or near 2026-02-27 (UPS Weekly, DOL.TO Monthly, AMD Monthly signals, NFLX, CVS, MTY.TO, GDX, BTI, ATD.TO, ARM, MAR, PPH, TD.TO, SBUX)
- **Lateness epidemic:** Most signals aged 2-12+ months with 10-40%+ price appreciation already captured
- **Directional conflicts:** GS shows Monthly Long vs Weekly Short conflict requiring resolution

### 2. MULTI-CONFIRMATION LEADERS (All Tier C Due to Issues)

#### **Top Multi-Confirmation Bundles:**

1. **C6L.SI (Singapore Airlines)** — 4 confirmations, all Short:
   - Daily OSCILLATOR DELTA (fresh, 4 days, but 3.16% adverse move)
   - Monthly FRACTAL TRACK (1.9 months, -12.19% adverse MTM—**LATE**)
   - Quarterly FRACTAL TRACK (2.4 years, -11.15% adverse MTM—**VERY LATE**)
   - **Status:** Fresh Daily signal has potential, but Monthly/Quarterly signals are aged with adverse performance. **Tier C: HOLD FOR REVIEW (Mixed Timeliness)**

2. **AMD** — 2 confirmations, both Long:
   - Weekly FRACTAL TRACK (5 days, +0.03% MTM, 100% win rate)
   - Monthly TRENDPULSE (7 months, +13.56% MTM, **EXIT TRIGGERED 2026-02-27**)
   - **Status:** Weekly signal is fresh and compelling (100% win rate, 14.45 Sharpe), but Monthly EXIT creates contra indicator. **Tier C: HOLD FOR REVIEW (Contra Indicator—Exit)**

3. **DOL.TO** — 3 confirmations, all Long:
   - Daily TRENDPULSE (3 days, +2.27% MTM, 100% win rate)
   - Weekly BASELINEDIVERGENCE (5 days, +4.54% MTM, 84.81% win rate)
   - Monthly TRENDPULSE (9.1 months, +13.78% MTM, **EXIT TRIGGERED 2026-02-27**)
   - **Status:** Daily/Weekly signals fresh and strong, but Monthly EXIT reduces authorization confidence. **Tier C: HOLD FOR REVIEW (Contra Indicator—Exit)**

4. **MCD (McDonald's)** — 3 confirmations, all Long:
   - 2x Daily FRACTAL TRACK (1.2-1.7 months, +10.42-11.45% MTM)
   - Weekly TRENDPULSE (2.7 months, +9.58% MTM)
   - **Status:** All signals have **breached T1/T2 targets** and MCD made **new all-time high $341.35**. **Tier C: HOLD FOR REVIEW (Profit-taking / At-Target / New High)**

5. **UPS** — 2 confirmations, both Long:
   - Daily FRACTAL TRACK (0 days, fresh, 90.91% win rate)
   - Weekly TRENDPULSE (7.9 months, +11.36% MTM, **EXIT TRIGGERED 2026-02-27**)
   - **Status:** Daily signal is brand new and compelling, but Weekly EXIT creates contra indicator. **Tier C: HOLD FOR REVIEW (Contra Indicator—Exit, but Daily signal fresh)**

6. **SONY** — 2 confirmations, both Long:
   - Daily TRENDPULSE (0 days, fresh, 85.71% win rate)
   - Weekly FRACTAL TRACK (5 days, +5.15% MTM, 100% win rate)
   - **Status:** Both signals very fresh (0-5 days), strong win rates. Weekly signal near T1 ($22.96, current $23.06). **Tier C: HOLD FOR REVIEW (Near T1 on Weekly, but Daily fresh)**

7. **AIA.NZ** — 2 confirmations, both Long:
   - Weekly TRENDPULSE (0 days, fresh, 100% win rate)
   - Daily TRENDPULSE (4 days, +2.35% MTM, 82.05% win rate)
   - **Status:** Both signals very fresh (0-4 days), excellent win rates. **Tier C: HOLD FOR REVIEW (Minor concerns, but strongest fresh multi-confirmation)**

### 3. SECTOR/GEOGRAPHY INSIGHTS

**Strong Sectors/Regions:**
- **New Zealand equities:** ATM.NZ (2 signals), AIA.NZ (2 signals), CNU.NZ, ^NZ50 all show Long signals with 82-100% win rates
- **Canadian equities:** DOL.TO (3 signals), TRI.TO, XIU.TO, MX.TO, BYD.TO, KXS.TO (2 signals)
- **US Financials:** BAC, JPM (both Daily FRACTAL TRACK, 100% win rates, support re-test)
- **Semiconductors/Tech:** AMD, NVDA (2 signals), TSM, ARM, VGT
- **Consumer:** MCD (3 signals), ABNB, UBER, SONY (2 signals)

**Weak Sectors/Regions (Short signals):**
- **Airlines:** C6L.SI (Singapore Airlines, 4 Short signals)
- **Asia IT/Internet:** WIPRO.NS (India IT, Short), KWEB (China internet, Short)
- **Canadian Financials:** TD.TO (Short, but **EXIT triggered with -12.95% adverse MTM**)

### 4. FRESH SIGNAL OPPORTUNITIES (Tier C, Closest to Tier A)

**Signals 0-5 days old with minimal adverse movement:**

1. **UPS Daily FRACTAL TRACK** (0 days, 90.91% win rate, +18.78% CAGR alpha) — **BEST FRESH SIGNAL**
2. **SONY Daily TRENDPULSE** (0 days, 85.71% win rate, +4.12% CAGR alpha)
3. **AIA.NZ Weekly TRENDPULSE** (0 days, 100% win rate, +5.12% CAGR alpha)
4. **UBER Weekly DELTADRIFT** (0 days, 100% win rate, +9.35% CAGR alpha)
5. **TRI.TO Weekly DELTADRIFT** (0 days, 100% win rate, −0.94% CAGR alpha but 1.52 Sharpe vs 0.34 B&H)
6. **XIU.TO Weekly TRENDPULSE** (0 days, 93.75% win rate, +0.66% CAGR alpha)
7. **BYD.TO Daily FRACTAL TRACK** (0 days, 85.71% win rate, **+26.81% CAGR alpha—highest**)
8. **CNU.NZ Weekly TRENDPULSE** (0 days, 100% win rate)
9. **ATM.NZ Daily/Weekly TRENDPULSE** (0 days, 91.89%/90% win rates)
10. **MX.TO Weekly TRENDPULSE** (0 days, 82.61% win rate, +8.0% CAGR alpha)

**Why Tier C (not Tier A):**
- Most lack explicit `lateness_gate`, `progress`, or `rr_to_nearest_support_stop` fields in model output
- Several have conflicting signals (exits on related rows) creating contra indicators
- Some have target proximity issues (SONY Weekly near T1)
- Missing detailed risk framing prevents full Tier A approval

### 5. PROFIT-TAKING / EXIT ZONE SIGNALS (Tier C)

**Signals with exits triggered or at/near targets:**

1. **MCD** (3 signals): All breached T1/T2, new all-time high $341.35
2. **GDX**: EXIT triggered 2026-02-26, made new all-time high $115.99, +12.46% MTM
3. **XLU**: +11.44% MTM, breached T1/T2, new all-time high $47.795
4. **WMT**: +9.64% MTM, breached T1/T2 (progress 180% of avg win)
5. **ATZ.TO**: +43.48% MTM (274% of avg win—**EXTREME**)
6. **MAR**: EXIT triggered 2026-02-27, +25.08% MTM, breached T1/T2
7. **PPH**: EXIT triggered 2026-02-27, +23.15% MTM, 1.9 years old
8. **ACWX**: +22.17% MTM (103% of avg win), at T2 target
9. **DOL.TO Monthly**: EXIT triggered 2026-02-27, +13.78% MTM, 9.1 months old
10. **UPS Weekly**: EXIT triggered 2026-02-26, +11.36% MTM, 7.9 months old

**Action:** These are **NOT fresh entry opportunities**. Existing holders should consider profit-taking or tightening stops to lock in gains.

### 6. NEGATIVE PERFORMANCE SIGNALS (Tier C, Avoid)

**Signals with adverse MTM or negative alpha:**

1. **TD.TO Short**: EXIT triggered, **−12.95% adverse MTM**, 0% forward testing win rate, 0% recent performance
2. **SBUX Long**: EXIT triggered, **−8.97% adverse MTM**, −2.16% CAGR alpha, 1.1 years old
3. **C6L.SI Monthly Short**: **−12.19% adverse MTM**, 1.9 months old
4. **C6L.SI Quarterly Short**: **−11.15% adverse MTM**, 2.4 years old
5. **MTY.TO Long**: EXIT triggered at loss, **−3.07% MTM**
6. **HDFCBANK.NS Long**: **−2.64% adverse MTM**, price below entry/Recent Extrema support

**Action:** Avoid fresh entries. Existing holders should exit or tighten stops.

### 7. DIRECTIONAL CONFLICTS (Tier C, Requires Resolution)

**GS (Goldman Sachs):**
- **Monthly Long** (2025-08-31, +15.34% MTM, 100% win rate, 1.46 Sharpe, approaching T1 $889.90)
- **Weekly Short** (2026-01-04, +5.99% MTM, 100% win rate, 3.08 Sharpe, near T1 $872.65)
- **Conflict:** User must choose timeframe priority. Monthly Long is late (64.6% progress toward avg target). Weekly Short is performing but moderately late (2.08× avg holding period).
- **Action:** Monitor; do not initiate fresh capital in either direction until one exits or price breaks key level ($800 for Long exit, $920 for Short exit).

### 8. FORWARD TESTING PERFORMANCE (Aggregate Metrics)

**By Function (Across ALL Assets, reported):**
- **DELTADRIFT:** 77.16-90.36% win rate, 15 days–2.3 months avg hold
- **TRENDPULSE:** 73.02-82.2% win rate, 1.4 months–9.3 months avg hold
- **FRACTAL TRACK:** 50.0-67.74% win rate, 1.5 months–10.2 months avg hold
- **BASELINEDIVERGENCE:** 68.44% win rate, 3.3 months avg hold
- **OSCILLATOR DELTA:** 64.41% win rate, 1.3 month avg hold

**Latest 6-Month Performance (Across ALL Assets, reported):**
- **DELTADRIFT:** 72.73-83.85% performance
- **TRENDPULSE:** 91.56-95.89% performance
- **FRACTAL TRACK:** 92.68-94.52% performance
- **BASELINEDIVERGENCE:** 73.68% performance
- **OSCILLATOR DELTA:** 53.85% performance

**Interpretation:** Recent 6-month performance is strong (72-96%) across most functions, validating model accuracy. Forward testing shows more conservative win rates (50-90%), appropriate for real-world expectations.

## TIER C SUMMARY (ALL SIGNALS)

**Total Signals Evaluated:** 72 distinct signals across 8 parallel processing groups

**Tier A Qualified:** 0 (zero)

**Tier C (HOLD FOR REVIEW):** 72 signals, categorized as:

### C1. FRESH SIGNALS (Monitoring for Entry) — 15 signals
- **Best candidates** if minor issues resolved: UPS Daily, SONY Daily, AIA.NZ Weekly, UBER Weekly, BYD.TO Daily, ATM.NZ Daily/Weekly

## CRITICAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

**For Existing Positions:**
- **TAKE PROFIT:** MCD, GDX, XLU, WMT, ATZ.TO, MAR, PPH, ACWX (all at/past targets)
- **EXIT:** TD.TO, SBUX, MTY.TO, C6L.SI Monthly/Quarterly (adverse performance)
- **TIGHTEN STOPS:** DOL.TO Monthly, UPS Weekly, AMD Monthly (exits triggered but still in profit)

**For Fresh Capital:**
- **MONITOR (Tier C, closest to Tier A):** UPS Daily, SONY Daily, AIA.NZ Weekly, UBER Weekly, BYD.TO Daily, ATM.NZ Daily/Weekly
- **WAIT FOR PULLBACK:** Most signals have appreciated 10-40%; await retracement to support levels
- **AVOID:** TD.TO, SBUX, C6L.SI Monthly/Quarterly, MTY.TO, HDFCBANK.NS (negative MTM)

### 2. RISK MANAGEMENT IMPERATIVES

1. **Position Sizing:** Given zero Tier A approvals, reduce position sizes by 50-75% vs normal for any Tier C signals considered
2. **Stop-Loss Discipline:** Use reported support levels (Recent Extrema, Horizontal, F-Stack, EMA 200); no exceptions
3. **Profit-Taking:** For signals at/past targets, take 50-75% profit and trail stops on remainder
4. **Timeframe Conflicts:** Resolve GS Long/Short conflict before any action
5. **Contra Indicator Respect:** Do not fight exits (12+ signals exited on 2026-02-27); await re-confirmation

### 3. MARKET ENVIRONMENT ASSESSMENT

**Current State (2026-02-27):**
- **Late-cycle characteristics:** Most signals aged with significant appreciation already captured
- **Profit-taking dominance:** 18 signals at/past targets suggest market exhaustion in many names
- **Exit cascade:** 12+ exits on single day (2026-02-27) indicates model-wide risk-off signal
- **Fresh signal scarcity:** Only 15 signals <5 days old, most with minor disqualifying issues
- **Sector divergence:** Strong (NZ equities, Canadian equities, US financials) vs weak (airlines, Asia IT/internet)

**Interpretation:** Market is in **transition phase**. Many trends maturing (profit-taking mode), but new trends emerging (fresh signals). **Conservative stance warranted:** await clearer entry points (pullbacks to support) or fresh signal confirmations without contra indicators.

### 4. MONITORING PRIORITIES

**Daily Monitoring (Highest Priority):**
1. **UPS Daily FRACTAL TRACK** — Fresh (0 days), 90.91% win rate, await pullback to $115 range
2. **SONY Daily TRENDPULSE** — Fresh (0 days), 85.71% win rate, entry $23.04-$23.06
3. **BYD.TO Daily FRACTAL TRACK** — Fresh (0 days), 85.71% win rate, +26.81% CAGR alpha (highest)
4. **AIA.NZ Weekly TRENDPULSE** — Fresh (0 days), 100% win rate, entry $8.85-$9.16
5. **UBER Weekly DELTADRIFT** — Fresh (0 days), 100% win rate, entry $72.99-$75.42

**Weekly Review:**
- **AMD Weekly FRACTAL TRACK** (5 days, 100% win rate, but Monthly EXIT creates contra indicator)
- **DOL.TO Daily/Weekly** (3-5 days, 100%/84.81% win rates, but Monthly EXIT creates contra indicator)
- **SONY Weekly FRACTAL TRACK** (5 days, 100% win rate, near T1 $22.96)
- **TSM Weekly TRENDPULSE** (5 days, 100% win rate, −1.69% CAGR alpha but 1.65 Sharpe)
- **CNR.TO Weekly TRENDPULSE** (5 days, 88% win rate, +1.56% CAGR alpha)

**Monthly Review:**
- **GS Monthly Long** vs **Weekly Short** conflict resolution
- **All profit-taking signals** for exit timing optimization
- **Negative performance signals** for stop-loss execution

---

## FINAL ASSESSMENT

**Market Grade: C+ (Challenging)**

The filtered signal universe reveals a market in **late-cycle transition**, characterized by:
- **Maturity:** Most opportunities have appreciated significantly (10-40%+), placing them past optimal entry
- **Exits:** Model-wide risk-off signal on 2026-02-27 (12+ exits) suggests caution
- **Fresh Scarcity:** Only 15 signals <5 days old, most with minor technical disqualifications
- **Quality:** Strong historical metrics (70-100% win rates, positive CAGR alpha) but timing challenges
- **Opportunity:** New trends emerging (NZ equities, select Canadian/US names) but require patience for entry

**Strategic Posture:**
1. **Existing Positions:** Aggressively take profits on at-target signals; exit negative performers
2. **Fresh Capital:** Wait for pullbacks on monitored fresh signals (UPS Daily, SONY Daily, BYD.TO Daily, AIA.NZ Weekly, UBER Weekly)
3. **Risk Management:** Strict stop-loss discipline; reduced position sizing (50-75% of normal)
4. **Patience:** Market environment favors waiting for clearer setups over forcing entries

**Confidence Level:** **MODERATE** for monitored fresh signals (Tier C); **LOW** for immediate deployment given zero Tier A approvals.
