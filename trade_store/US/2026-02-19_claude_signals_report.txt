## KEY INSIGHTS AND STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. **Precious Metals Sector Shows Exceptional Strength**
- **GLD** (100% win rate, +14.27% CAGR alpha, Sharpe 2.41) and **SLV** (93.33% win rate, +12.62% CAGR alpha, Sharpe 1.56) both confirmed same-day (2026-02-19)
- **WPM** (Wheaton Precious Metals) adds diversification with 100% win rate and +16.6% CAGR alpha
- Collectively suggest safe-haven demand and inflation-hedge positioning

### 2. **Multi-Confirmation Signals Increase Conviction**
- **USCI** (Commodities): Dual confirmation (FRACTAL TRACK 94.44% + TRENDPULSE 100% win rates) on 2026-02-19
- **ATM.NZ**: Triple confirmation (2× FRACTAL TRACK + 1× DELTADRIFT) with 92.31%/75% win rates
- **AMD**: Triple Monthly TRENDPULSE signals (87.5% win rate, +14.63% CAGR alpha) across 2024-2025 entries
- Multi-function/multi-timeframe alignment reduces false-signal risk

### 3. **Geographic and Sectoral Diversification**

- **Weekly signals** (TRENDPULSE cluster): PG, ATD.TO, CNR.TO, MX.TO, GNE.NZ, SJ.TO, NA.TO, NVDA — confirmed 2026-02-13/2026-02-15, indicating intermediate-term momentum
- **Monthly signals** (longer-term structural): TSM, ^BVSP, GS, PPH, BNS.TO, ACWX, ASHR, ^DJI, NZDCAD=X — confirmed 2026-01-31, suggesting position-building opportunities

### 5. **Risk Management Through Defined Support Levels**
Every qualified signal includes multiple support references:
- Recent Extrema (short-term swing lows)
- Horizontal levels (historical price congestion)
- F-Stack levels (Fibonacci-based support zones)
- EMA 200 (long-term trend support)
- Track levels (retracement-based anchors for FRACTAL TRACK signals)

### 6. **Forward Testing Validates Strategy Robustness**
- FRACTAL TRACK: 67.74% win rate across 62 trades (5.1 months avg hold)

- **GS**: P/E not provided but +4.43% CAGR alpha suggests value
- **NA.TO**: P/E 17.51 (reasonable for Canadian financials)

### 8. **Contra Indicators and Profit-Taking Zones Identified**
Several high-quality signals excluded from fresh entry due to:
- **Late-stage positioning**: Multiple PG Daily signals (5.2-8.9 months elapsed vs 1.1-month avg hold)
- **At-target conditions**: MAR FRACTAL TRACK Monthly (+28.07% MTM, exit triggered), ATZ.TO Monthly (+50.15% MTM)
- **Recent exits**: XLU (TRENDPULSE + OSCILLATOR DELTA exits 2026-02-18/19), IHI (DELTADRIFT exit 2026-02-18)
- **Negative alpha exceptions**: WMT (-1.08%), ATD.TO (-3.66% but included in Tier A due to 90% win rate)

## TIER A — CONSOLIDATED RANKED QUALIFIED SIGNALS (TOP 23 BUNDLES)

### **TIER A-1: EXCEPTIONAL MULTI-CONFIRMATION OPPORTUNITIES**

#### **1. USCI (United States Commodity Index Fund) — LONG — confirmations=2**
**Synopsis:** Dual same-day confirmation (FRACTAL TRACK 94.44% + TRENDPULSE 100% win rates) on 2026-02-19. Current price $82.76 is 3.4% above FRACTAL TRACK entry, providing early-stage positioning. Forward testing: 67.74%-82.2% win rates.

**Combined Signal Strength:**
- FRACTAL TRACK: 94.44% win rate (18 trades, 5 years), Sharpe 1.7, CAGR alpha +8.95%
- TRENDPULSE: 100% win rate (14 trades, 4 years), Sharpe 1.78, CAGR alpha -2.01% (note negative alpha but 100% win rate)
- **Actionable Next Step:** HOLD/ADD on pullback to $80-$82 (Track Level/Signal zone); first targets $84.64-$87.87 (+2-6%); stop below $79.86 (Recent Extrema, 3.1% risk). Dual confirmation increases conviction despite TRENDPULSE negative alpha.

---

#### **2. ATM.NZ (A2 Milk Company) — LONG — confirmations=3**
**Synopsis:** Triple confirmation (2× FRACTAL TRACK Daily + 1× DELTADRIFT Daily) all from 2026-01-22. Current price $11.47 shows +15.39% MTM over 28 days. Exceptional win rates: 92.31% (FRACTAL TRACK), 75% (DELTADRIFT).

**Combined Signal Strength:**
- FRACTAL TRACK #1: 92.31% win rate, Sharpe 1.69, CAGR alpha +27.21%
- DELTADRIFT: 75% win rate, Sharpe 0.11, CAGR alpha +6.98%
- **Caution:** T1/T2 targets already reached for both FRACTAL TRACK signals; exit signals triggered 2026-02-16/17.
- **Actionable Next Step:** TAKE PARTIAL / TRAIL STOP — First targets reached; trail stop to $9.74 (EMA 200); target higher levels ($14.19+ FRACTAL TRACK T3, $21.86+ F-Stack) only if momentum persists. Not ideal for fresh entry at current level; await pullback to $9.74-$9.93.

---

#### **3. AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) — LONG — confirmations=3**
**Synopsis:** Three Monthly TRENDPULSE signals (2024-01-31, 2024-02-29, 2025-07-31) all open with 87.5% win rate and +14.63% CAGR alpha. Current price $203.37 reflects +15-21% gains across entries.

**Combined Signal Strength:**
- 87.5% win rate (16 trades, 20 years), Sharpe 1.29, CAGR alpha +14.63%
- Market context: P/E 78.2, PEG 0.65 (undervalued vs growth)
- **Caution:** All three entries show exit signals triggered 2026-02-19; 2024 entries are 2+ years old (far exceeding 10.8-month avg hold); 2025-07-31 entry at 6.8 months is approaching avg hold.
- **Contra indicator:** AMD FRACTAL TRACK Short (Daily, 2026-02-19) conflicts with Long direction.
- **Actionable Next Step:** TAKE PARTIAL / CONSIDER EXIT — Exit signals triggered today across all three entries. 2024 entries: close entirely or reduce to <10%; 2025-07-31 entry: take 50-75% profit, trail stop to $170.08 (F-Stack 1) for remaining position targeting $338.04 (T1, +66%). Directional conflict with new Short signal reduces confidence for fresh Long entries.
