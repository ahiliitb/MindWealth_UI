### 2. **Perfect Historical Win Rates: Elite Performance Signals**

**100% Win Rate Signals (Small Sample Caution Applied):**

- **VGT** (15 trades, 20 years): 100% win rate, +4.33% CAGR alpha, 12.76 Sharpe
- **JETS** (11 trades, 5 years): 100% win rate, +13.36% CAGR alpha, 2.44 Sharpe
- **ETH-USD** (5 trades, 10 years): 100% win rate, +0.37% CAGR alpha, 1.56 Sharpe
- **SONY** (18 trades, 20 years): 100% win rate, +4.49% CAGR alpha, 2.5 Sharpe
- **HYG** (8 trades, 18 years): 100% win rate, +5.85% CAGR alpha, 0.25 Sharpe
- **KXS.TO** (4 trades, 11 years): 100% win rate, -3.1% CAGR alpha, 14.45 Sharpe (note: negative alpha but exceptional Sharpe)
- **DOL.TO** (31 trades, 4 years): 100% win rate, -0.56% CAGR alpha, 1.15 Sharpe
- **USCI** (14 trades, 4 years): 100% win rate, -2.01% CAGR alpha, 1.78 Sharpe
- **EEM** (13 trades, 4 years): 100% win rate, -0.96% CAGR alpha, 2.11 Sharpe
- **MSE.PA** (20 trades, 4 years): 100% win rate, +1.25% CAGR alpha, 1.09 Sharpe
- **XIU.TO** (21 trades, 4 years): 100% win rate, +2.34% CAGR alpha, 2.12 Sharpe
- **XLU** (16 trades, 5 years): 100% win rate, +13.13% CAGR alpha, 2.44 Sharpe
- **MCD** (19 trades, 10 years): 100% win rate, +0.75% CAGR alpha, 1.39 Sharpe
- **GS** (14 trades, 20 years): 100% win rate, +4.43% CAGR alpha, 1.46 Sharpe
- **ATZ.TO** (4 trades, 20 years): 100% win rate, +3.35% CAGR alpha, 1.35 Sharpe

- **SFTBY** (4 trades, 13 years): 100% win rate, +7.13% CAGR alpha, 1.47 Sharpe (SHORT)

**Interpretation**: While 100% win rates are compelling, sample sizes vary significantly. Signals with 15+ trades (VGT, SONY, XLU, MCD, GS, XIU.TO) carry higher statistical confidence than those with <10 trades (JETS, ETH-USD, HYG, KXS.TO, ATZ.TO, ACWX, MAR, SFTBY).

### 3. **CAGR Alpha Champions: Outperformance Leaders**

**Highest CAGR Alpha (Strategy - Buy & Hold):**

1. **BIPC.TO**: +21.54% (93.33% win rate, 1.2 Sharpe)
2. **PFE**: +17.33% (93.33% win rate, 0.41 Sharpe)
3. **BPCL.NS**: +7.5% (86.67% win rate, 1.08 Sharpe)
4. **SJ.TO Daily**: +16.38% (93.75% win rate, 1.63 Sharpe)
5. **AMD Monthly**: +14.63% (87.5% win rate, 1.29 Sharpe)

10. **AIA.NZ**: +10.69% (82.05% win rate, 0.66 Sharpe)

**Strategic Implication**: These signals demonstrate material outperformance vs passive Buy & Hold strategies, validating active signal-based approaches for alpha generation.

### 4. **Negative CAGR Alpha but Superior Risk-Adjusted Returns**

**Signals with Negative Alpha but Exceptional Sharpe Ratios:**

- **KXS.TO**: -3.1% CAGR alpha BUT 14.45 Sharpe (vs 0.58 B&H)
- **EEM**: -0.96% CAGR alpha BUT 2.11 Sharpe (vs 0.14 B&H)
- **WMT**: -1.08% CAGR alpha BUT 1.49 Sharpe (vs 0.58 B&H)
- **MTY.TO**: -4.15% CAGR alpha BUT -0.11 Sharpe (vs 0.29 B&H, both negative)
- **USCI**: -2.01% CAGR alpha BUT 1.78 Sharpe
- **DOL.TO**: -0.56% CAGR alpha BUT 1.15 Sharpe

**Interpretation**: These signals capture short-term swings with superior risk management (higher Sharpe) despite long-term underperformance vs Buy & Hold. **Recommended for tactical swing trades (2-6 month horizons) rather than strategic long-term holds.**

### 7. **Risk Management Framework**

**Support Level Hierarchy (by proximity to current price):**

- **Tight Stops (<5% below current)**: VGT (2.72%), ^NSEI (1.70%), HDFCBANK.NS (0.41%), SONY (1.91%), BIPC.TO (4.42%), PFE (1.62%), BPCL.NS (3.87%), MTY.TO (5.1-5.2%), HYG (0.6%)
- **Moderate Stops (5-15% below current)**: TSM (29.07%), CNR.TO (8.6%), NVDA (6.54%), EURUSD=X (14.48% Horizontal, 0.63% EMA 200), RELIANCE.NS (1.7%), XIU.TO (10.3%), MSE.PA (8.2%)
- **Wide Stops (>15% below current)**: AMD (28.3%), TSLA (1.5%), ETH-USD (19.8%), WMT (19.5%), UPS (16.2%)

**Risk-Reward Profiles (to first targets):**

- **Excellent RR (>3×)**: BPCL.NS (7.17×), SJ.TO Daily (7.56×), JETS (5.10×), GS (3.44×), NVDA (3.08×)
- **Favorable RR (1-3×)**: BIPC.TO (1.17×), CNR.TO (1.0-1.2×), AMD (varies by stop), SFTBY (1.5×), MAR (0.20× to T1, unfavorable due to proximity)
- **Marginal/Unfavorable RR (<1×)**: XLY (1.78×), PFE (0.67×), EURUSD=X (0.54×), GBPSGD=X (0.26-0.92×), ATM.NZ (0.10×), MTY.TO (1.20-1.25×), MSE.PA (0.05×), PPH (0.01×)

**Strategic Implication**: Fresh signals with excellent RR (BPCL.NS, SJ.TO Daily, JETS, GS) offer best new entry opportunities. Signals with marginal RR are better suited for profit-taking or hold-with-trailing-stop strategies.

### 8. **Forward Testing Validation**

**Aggregate Forward Testing Performance (Across ALL Assets):**

- **FRACTAL TRACK**: 63.64-67.74% win rates / 62-132 trades / 5.1-7.5 months avg hold
- **TRENDPULSE**: 80.3-82.2% win rates / 269-528 trades / 1.4-3.6 months avg hold
- **DELTADRIFT**: 77.16-90.36% win rates / 83-394 trades / 15 days-2.3 months avg hold
- **BASELINEDIVERGENCE**: 68.44% win rate / 564 trades / 3.3 months avg hold
- **SIGMASHELL**: 75.0% win rate / 8 trades / 5.3 months avg hold

**Latest Past 6 Months Performance:**

- **FRACTAL TRACK**: 93.09-94.52% performance / 73-304 trades
- **TRENDPULSE**: 91.56-92.11% performance / 154-304 trades
- **DELTADRIFT**: 72.73-83.85% performance / 11-130 trades
- **BASELINEDIVERGENCE**: 73.68% performance / 19 trades

**Interpretation**: Recent 6-month performance (91-95%) significantly exceeds historical backtested win rates (64-82%), suggesting current market conditions favor these quantitative strategies. However, forward testing win rates (64-82%) are more conservative than backtested rates (70-100%), validating realistic expectations.

### 9. **Contra Indicators and Directional Conflicts**

**Assets with Recent Exit Signals (Reduce Fresh Entry Confidence):**

- **AMD**: Daily FRACTAL TRACK Short exited 2026-02-23 (+3.33% MTM). **Reinforcement interpretation**: Exit of short reduces overlap risk for Weekly/Monthly longs, but recency (2 days) warrants caution until Daily/Weekly alignment confirmed.
- **TSM**: Monthly DELTADRIFT Short exited 2026-02-25 (-27.59% MTM, losing position). **Reinforcement**: Exit of losing short confirms directional shift to bullish bias for Weekly TRENDPULSE Long.
- **PFE**: Weekly TRENDPULSE Long exited 2026-02-22 (6.01% MTM). **Contra indicator** for Daily FRACTAL TRACK Long, but different timeframes reduce conflict severity.
- **SJ.TO**: Weekly TRENDPULSE Long exited 2026-02-25 (+4.71% MTM). **Contra indicator** for Daily FRACTAL TRACK Long, but exit was profitable and Daily signal is fresh.
- **BTI**: Daily TRENDPULSE Long exited 2026-02-25 (+3.99% MTM). **Contra indicator** for newer Daily TRENDPULSE Long (2026-02-20), reducing fresh entry confidence.
- **ATD.TO**: Daily TRENDPULSE Long exited 2026-02-24 (+3.12% MTM). **Contra indicator** for Daily TRENDPULSE Long (2026-02-11), reducing fresh entry confidence.
- **EEM**: Daily TRENDPULSE Long exited 2026-02-23 (+4.92% MTM). **At-target exclusion** from Tier A.

**Assets with Directional Conflicts (Tier C HOLD FOR REVIEW):**

- **C6L.SI**: LONG (SIGMASHELL Daily, 2025-09-01, +8.97% MTM) vs THREE SHORT signals (OSCILLATOR DELTA Daily 2026-02-23 -3.02% MTM, FRACTAL TRACK Monthly 2025-12-31 -12.03% MTM, FRACTAL TRACK Quarterly 2023-09-30 -10.99% MTM). **Action**: HOLD FOR REVIEW; directional clarity required before fresh entries.

### 10. **New All-Time Highs: Momentum Confirmation with Late-Entry Risk**

**Assets Achieving New All-Time Highs on 2026-02-25:**

- **XLU**: $47.43 (current $47.36, -0.15% below high) — T1/T2 exceeded, profit-taking mode
- **ACWX**: $74.92 (current $74.84, -0.11% below high) — All targets exceeded, profit-taking mode
- **EEM**: $63.43 (current $63.31, -0.19% below high) — Tier C exclusion, at-target
- **MSE.PA**: €69.00 (current €68.98, -0.03% below high) — T2 exceeded, T1 near
- **EFA**: $105.80 (current $105.66, -0.13% below high) — T1/T2 exceeded, profit-taking mode

**Interpretation**: New highs confirm strong momentum but also signal late-entry risk. **Recommended action**: HOLD existing positions with trailing stops; AVOID fresh entries at all-time highs unless strong pullback to support levels occurs.

## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS BY STRATEGY TYPE

### **For Aggressive Growth Portfolios:**

**Focus**: Highest CAGR alpha signals with strong win rates

- **Primary Allocations**: BIPC.TO (+21.54% alpha), PFE (+17.33%), SJ.TO Daily (+16.38%), AMD Monthly (+14.63%), ATM.NZ (+14.84%), JETS (+13.36%), XLU (+13.13%), HDFCBANK.NS (+11.55%)
- **Action**: HOLD/ADD on fresh signals; TAKE PARTIAL on late-stage signals (AMD Monthly, XLU)
- **Risk Management**: Use F-Stack 1 or Recent Extrema supports for stops; target 10-20% position sizes given concentration risk

### **For Risk-Adjusted Portfolios:**

**Focus**: Highest Sharpe ratio signals with 100% win rates

- **Primary Allocations**: KXS.TO (14.45 Sharpe), VGT (12.76), JETS (2.44), XLU (2.44), SONY (2.5), MAR (2.24), XIU.TO (2.12), EEM (2.11)
- **Action**: HOLD with trailing stops; TAKE PARTIAL on signals exceeding historical avg gains
- **Risk Management**: Accept wider stops (10-20%) given superior risk-adjusted returns; target 5-10% position sizes

### **For Tactical Swing Traders:**

**Focus**: Fresh signals (0-7 days) with clear entry/exit frameworks

- **Primary Allocations**: XLY, JETS, MA, USCI, DOL.TO (all 0-1 days); PFE, BPCL.NS, BIPC.TO (1 day); GBPSGD=X, AIA.NZ, EURUSD=X (2 days)
- **Action**: ADD on current levels or pullbacks to entry anchors; target T1/T2 exits within 1-6 months
- **Risk Management**: Tight stops (3-10%); aggressive profit-taking at T1 (50% position) and T2 (remaining 50%)

### **For International/Diversified Portfolios:**

**Focus**: Multi-region exposure with strong local market signals

- **Asia-Pacific**: TSM, BPCL.NS, AIA.NZ, RELIANCE.NS, ^NSEI, HDFCBANK.NS, ATM.NZ (7 signals)
- **Canada**: SJ.TO, DOL.TO, CNR.TO, CNQ.TO, BIPC.TO, KXS.TO, ATD.TO, MTY.TO, XIU.TO, ATZ.TO (10 signals)
- **Europe**: EURUSD=X, GBPSGD=X, SONY, MSE.PA (4 signals)
- **Emerging Markets**: EEM, BPCL.NS, RELIANCE.NS, ^NSEI, HDFCBANK.NS (5 signals)
- **Action**: Allocate 10-20% per region; prioritize multi-confirmation signals (SJ.TO, AMD) for core holdings

### **For Conservative Income/Low-Volatility Portfolios:**

**Focus**: Negative CAGR alpha but superior Sharpe signals (risk-adjusted outperformers)

- **Primary Allocations**: KXS.TO (14.45 Sharpe), EEM (2.11 Sharpe), USCI (1.78 Sharpe), WMT (1.49 Sharpe), DOL.TO (1.15 Sharpe), HYG (0.25 Sharpe but 100% win rate)
- **Action**: HOLD for 2-6 month swing trades; avoid long-term holds given negative alpha
- **Risk Management**: Trail stops aggressively to EMA 200 or Recent Extrema; target 3-8% gains rather than extended runs

## CRITICAL RISK MANAGEMENT NOTES

### **Model-Output Integrity Issues Identified:**

1. **Missing `lateness_gate` and `rr_to_nearest_support_stop` fields** across all groups — computed manually where inputs available; adds minor uncertainty vs precomputed values
2. **WIPRO.NS directional ordering conflict** — Short signal but T1 target above current price (Tier C exclusion)
3. **C6L.SI directional conflicts** — LONG vs SHORT signals across multiple functions (Tier C exclusion)
4. **EMA 200 context missing** — could not apply EMA target rule logic in all cases

### **Contra Indicators Requiring Monitoring:**

- **AMD**: Recent Daily short exit (2 days ago); monitor for Daily/Weekly alignment before aggressive adds
- **TSM**: Recent Monthly short exit (losing position); reinforces Weekly long but monitor for reversal
- **PFE**: Recent Weekly long exit; reduces confidence for Daily long despite different timeframes
- **SJ.TO**: Recent Weekly long exit; reduces confidence for Daily long despite different timeframes
- **BTI, ATD.TO**: Recent Daily long exits; reduces confidence for newer Daily long signals

### **Signals Excluded from Tier A (Tier C HOLD FOR REVIEW):**

- **SBUX**: Negative CAGR alpha (-2.16%), current drawdown (-9.05%), exit triggered
- **KWEB**: Exit triggered on analysis date, forward testing only 50% win rate
- **WIPRO.NS**: Brand new signal (0 days), directional ordering conflict
- **TD.TO**: Negative MTM (-13.01%), exit triggered, forward testing 0% win rate
- **C6L.SI**: Directional conflicts (LONG vs SHORT), negative MTM on short signals
- **EEM**: At-target exclusion, T1/T2 exceeded, new all-time high
- **ATM.NZ 2025-11-04 signal**: LATE (3.8 months vs 20-day avg), minimal progress
