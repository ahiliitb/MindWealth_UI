# COMPREHENSIVE CROSS-GROUP SYNTHESIS REPORT

**ANALYSIS_DATE: 2026-02-17**

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

After synthesizing 8 parallel processing groups analyzing 80+ signals across global markets, **22 distinct asset bundles** qualify for Tier A (approved risk) with **35 total Tier A signals**. The analysis reveals strong multi-confirmation opportunities in semiconductors (TSM, AMD, NVDA), Canadian financials/retail (ATZ.TO, BNS.TO, SJ.TO, NA.TO), healthcare (PPH), and emerging markets (ASHR, ^BVSP, ACWX). All Tier A signals meet strict criteria: ≥70% historical win rates, confirmed status, clear entry/target/risk frameworks, and appropriate timeliness.

**Key Finding:** Multi-confirmation setups (ATM.NZ with 3 signals, AMD with 3 signals, PPH with 2 signals, CNQ.TO with 2 signals) demonstrate highest conviction, though several have triggered exits requiring profit-taking evaluation rather than fresh entries.

Consider adding on pullbacks to $190-195 range. **Exit Feb 2024 and Jan 2024 signals** — both far exceed historical holding periods (2+ years vs 10.8-month avg) and show minimal/moderate gains.

Primary target $229.63 (+24.2%), extended $256.53 (+38.7%). **Caution:** High historical volatility (worst MTM -47.56%) requires strict position sizing (max 3-5% portfolio weight).

## NEGATIVE CAGR ALPHA SIGNALS (Strategy Underperforms Buy-and-Hold)

**Policy Transparency (High Win Rates but Negative Alpha):**
1. **TSM:** -1.42% alpha (but Sharpe 1.28 vs 0.53 buy-and-hold) — Superior risk-adjusted returns justify inclusion
2. **^BVSP:** -1.73% alpha (but Sharpe 0.6 vs 0.38) — EM diversification with 90% win rate
3. **CNQ.TO:** -5.77% alpha (but 86.36% win rate) — Selective position sizing recommended
4. **DOL.TO:** -10.57% alpha (but Sharpe 2.59, 100% win rate) — Risk-adjusted returns justify inclusion
5. **MTY.TO (Tier C):** -4.15% alpha (79.17% win rate) — Exits triggered, avoid re-entry
6. **MFT.NZ (Tier C):** -1.62% alpha (91.3% win rate) — Late signal, exit triggered, avoid re-entry
7. **INFY (Tier C):** -3.98% alpha (92.86% win rate) — Avoid fresh entry, weak forward testing
8. **DIS (Tier C):** -0.62% alpha (80% win rate) — Underwater, avoid fresh entry

**Interpretation:** Negative CAGR alpha signals indicate the strategy's timing/exit discipline underperforms passive holding over full backtested period. However, several show superior Sharpe ratios (better risk-adjusted returns) and exceptional win rates, suggesting value in active management for volatility reduction and drawdown control. Position sizing should reflect negative alpha risk.

## MODEL INTEGRITY NOTES

**Directional Ordering Conflicts Detected:**
1. **CSCO Short (Row 2):** T1 $78.28 is ABOVE current $76.85 for SHORT signal (should be below). Use T2 $70.53 or T3 $50.64 as primary targets.
2. **UPS Short (Row 4):** T2 $116.03 is ABOVE current $115.51 for SHORT signal (should be below). Use T1 $110.60 or T3 $113.32 as primary targets.

**Data Integrity Issues:**
1. **UPS Short:** F-Stack 2 $532.25 appears to be data error (far above current $115.51).
2. **INFY Short:** F-Stack 2 $56.93 appears to be data error (far above current $14.75).
3. **NVO Long:** Missing F-Track support levels despite being FRACTAL TRACK signal. Current price -16.93% below signal suggests gap-down or adverse entry. Integrity concern blocks Tier A.

**Missing Dependencies (All Rows):**
- **rr_to_nearest_support_stop:** Not provided in any row. Risk-reward ratios computed from reported support/target levels where possible.
- **lateness_gate explicit field:** Not provided in most rows. Timeliness assessed using elapsed time vs avg holding period and price distance vs targets.
