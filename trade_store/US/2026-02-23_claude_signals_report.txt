### 2. **Precious Metals Sector Dominance**
- **GLD, WPM** show **perfect 100% historical win rates** (18 trades each, 5 years) with exceptional Sharpe ratios (2.41 and 1.92). CAGR alpha: +14.27% (GLD) and +16.6% (WPM).
- Both signals are **very fresh** (4 days elapsed), providing early-stage entry opportunities.
- WPM is already **at first target** ($155.11, current $155.86), suggesting partial profit-taking consideration.

### 3. **Semiconductor Sector Strength**
- **NVDA, AMD, VGT, TSM** all show strong signals with **multi-timeframe alignment** (Weekly intervals).
- **VGT**: 100% win rate (15 trades), **exceptional Sharpe 12.76** (best among all signals), CAGR alpha +4.33%.
- **TSM**: 100% win rate (19 trades), Sharpe 1.65, but **negative CAGR alpha -1.69%** (strategy underperformed buy-and-hold, though Sharpe is superior).
- **AMD**: Multi-confirmation (Weekly FRACTAL TRACK + Monthly TRENDPULSE), but **contra indicator present** (Daily Short exit 2026-02-23, +3.33% MTM), reducing fresh entry confidence.

### 4. **Forex Pair Excellence**
- **GBPSGD=X, EURUSD=X**: Both show **same-day fresh signals** (2026-02-23/19), minimal elapsed time, and strong historical performance.
- **EURUSD=X**: 83.33% win rate (12 trades), Sharpe 0.5, CAGR alpha +4.23%.
- **JPY=X**: 100% win rate (9 trades, 6 years), Sharpe 1.19, CAGR alpha +7.24%, **very fresh** (2 days elapsed).

### 5. **Canadian Equity Exposure**
- **CNQ.TO, CNR.TO**: Both show Weekly TRENDPULSE signals with strong win rates (86.36% and 88.0%).
- **CNR.TO**: Best RR ratio in equity cohort (1.42× to first target), positive CAGR alpha +1.56%, Sharpe 1.1.
- **CNQ.TO**: Dual timeframe confirmation (Weekly + Daily), but Weekly shows negative CAGR alpha -5.77% vs Daily positive +4.88%.

### 6. **International Diversification**
- **AIA.NZ** (New Zealand): 82.05% win rate, **strongest equity CAGR alpha +10.69%**, Sharpe 0.66.
- **HDFCBANK.NS** (India): 82.0% win rate (150 trades, large sample), CAGR alpha +11.55%, Sharpe 0.72.
- **SONY** (Japan): 100% win rate (18 trades), Sharpe 2.5, CAGR alpha +4.49%.
- **RELIANCE.NS** (India): 90.48% win rate (21 trades), Sharpe 1.68, CAGR alpha +3.9%.

### 7. **Risk Management Framework**
- All Tier A signals include **clearly defined support levels** (Recent Extrema, Horizontal, F-Stack, EMA 200), enabling disciplined stop-loss placement.
- Most signals show support levels **7-20% below current prices**, providing reasonable cushion.
- **Tight stops available** for short-term traders: GLD (Recent Extrema $427.13, -11.25% from current), BTI (Recent Extrema $58.87, -5.0% from current).

### 8. **Timeliness Considerations**
- **Very Fresh Signals (0-4 days)**: GBPSGD=X, EURUSD=X, JPY=X, GLD, WPM, USCI, DBC, BTI, GOOG, IFT.NZ, USO, FPH.NZ, NVDA, AMD, VGT, TSM, CNQ.TO, CNR.TO, HYG, SONY, RELIANCE.NS, GLXY, AIA.NZ.
- **Early-Stage Signals (1-2 months)**: EEM, EFA, MSE.PA, XIU.TO, ATM.NZ, MEL.NZ, JETS, MAR, SBUX, XLF.
- **Approaching Late-Stage**: SJ.TO (4.9 months, 64.6% progress to target), GS (5.9 months, at Historic Rise target), UPS (7.7 months, exceeded avg hold).

### 9. **Contra Indicators and Exits**
- **AMD**: Recent Daily Short exit (2026-02-19 to 2026-02-23, +3.33% MTM) reduces confidence for fresh Long entry, despite Weekly/Monthly Long signals.
- **NFLX**: Recent Quarterly Short exit (2025-12-31 to 2026-02-23, +18.92% MTM) reduces confidence for fresh Weekly Long entry.
- **SBUX**: Recent Weekly TRENDPULSE Long exit (2026-02-23, -11.98% loss) reduces confidence for fresh Daily FRACTAL TRACK Long entry.
- **TSM**: Recent Monthly Short exit (2026-02-23, -21.77% loss) **reinforces** Weekly Long signal (reduces short overlap risk).

### 10. **Negative Alpha Exceptions (Proceed with Caution)**
- **JETS**: 80.95% win rate but **negative CAGR alpha -5.66%** (strategy underperformed buy-and-hold). Included in Tier A due to strong forward testing (82.2%), but flagged.
- **NFLX**: 80% win rate but **negative CAGR alpha -15.88%**, negative Sharpe -0.03. Contra indicator present. Avoid fresh entry.
- **KXS.TO**: 100% win rate but **negative CAGR alpha -3.1%**. Exceptional Sharpe 14.45 but small sample (4 trades). Proceed with caution.
- **CNQ.TO Weekly**: 86.36% win rate but **negative CAGR alpha -5.77%**. Daily signal (+4.88% alpha) preferred.

## RISK / INTEGRITY NOTES

### Model-Output Integrity Issues:

1. **CSCO Short (Row 4)** – Directional ordering conflict: T1 target ($79.186) is **above** entry ($77.74) for SHORT signal. Expected: SHORT targets should be below entry. Excluded from Tier A.

2. **GS Short (Row 9)** – Directional ordering conflict: T1 target ($963.71) is **above** entry ($914.34) for SHORT signal. Excluded from Tier A.

3. **UPS Long (Row 1)** – T1 target ($103.1304) is **below** Signal Date Price ($104.13). For LONG signal, T1 below entry may represent a pivot/reference level rather than upside target. Current price $115.02 already above T1 and T2, suggesting targets met. No Tier A exclusion (other targets exist).

4. **ACWX Long (Row 2)** – T1 target ($59.9893) is **below** Signal Date Price ($60.94). For LONG signal, T1 below entry may represent pivot/reference. Current price $73.65 well above T1. No Tier A exclusion (T2 and other targets exist).

### Missing Dependencies Blocking Tier A:

- **rr_to_nearest_support_stop**: Not available in model output for all Tier A rows → cannot display pre-computed risk-reward ratios. Users must manually compute RR using reported entry anchors, targets, and support levels.

### Contra Indicator Summary:

1. **AMD Long** – Recent Daily FRACTAL TRACK Short exit (2026-02-19 to 2026-02-23, +3.33% MTM, 4 days hold). Reduces authorization confidence for fresh Long entry despite Weekly/Monthly Long signals. Short had 85% win rate, CAGR alpha +15.14%.

2. **NFLX Long** – Recent Quarterly FRACTAL TRACK Short exit (2025-12-31 to 2026-02-23, +18.92% MTM, 1.8 months hold). Reduces authorization confidence for fresh Weekly Long entry. Short had 100% win rate, CAGR alpha +6.27%.

3. **SBUX Long** – Recent Weekly TRENDPULSE Long exit (2026-02-23, **-11.98% loss**, 1.1 year hold). Reduces authorization confidence for fresh Daily FRACTAL TRACK Long entry. Weekly had 81.25% win rate but negative CAGR alpha -2.16%.

4. **TSM Long** – Recent Monthly DELTADRIFT Short exit (2026-02-23, **-21.77% loss**, 1.8 months hold). **Reinforcement logic applied**: EXIT_SHORT recently occurred; reduces overlap risk for new Weekly TRENDPULSE LONG. Not a mechanical contradiction; instead reinforces long bias as failed short suggests bullish reversal context.

5. **C6L.SI Long** – Recent OSCILLATOR DELTA Short (2026-02-23, 100% win rate, 4 trades, same-day opposing signal) + FRACTAL TRACK Short (2025-12-31, 92.86% win rate, 14 trades, currently -8.75% MTM). Reduces authorization confidence for Long entry. Excluded from Tier A.

### Directional Ordering Conflicts:
- **CSCO Short (Row 4)**, **GS Short (Row 9)**: T1 targets above entry for SHORT signals. Excluded from Tier A.
- **UPS Long (Row 1)**, **ACWX Long (Row 2)**: T1 targets below entry for LONG signals (may represent pivot references). No Tier A exclusion (other targets exist).

### Negative Alpha Exceptions (Tier A):

1. **JETS Long (Daily TRENDPULSE)** – **Negative CAGR alpha -5.66%** (Strategy CAGR -6.1% vs Buy & Hold -0.44%). Win rate 80.95% passes threshold, but negative alpha flagged. Proceed with caution.

2. **NFLX Long (Weekly DELTADRIFT)** – **Negative CAGR alpha -15.88%**, negative Sharpe -0.03. Contra indicator present. Avoid fresh entry.

3. **KXS.TO Long (Weekly DELTADRIFT)** – **Negative CAGR alpha -3.1%**. Exceptional Sharpe 14.45 but small sample (4 trades). Proceed with caution.

4. **CNQ.TO Weekly Long (TRENDPULSE)** – **Negative CAGR alpha -5.77%**. Daily signal (+4.88% alpha) preferred.

5. **TSM Long (Weekly TRENDPULSE)** – **Negative CAGR alpha -1.69%**, but Sharpe 1.65 >> Buy & Hold Sharpe 0.88. Included in Tier A due to superior risk-adjusted returns despite negative absolute alpha.

### Unconfirmed Signals:
**None in Tier A.** All Tier A signals are CONFIRMED.
