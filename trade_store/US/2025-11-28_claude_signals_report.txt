3. **Cryptocurrency sector showing strength** - Both COIN and BTC-USD appear among top signals with high win rates and positive CAGR differentials, suggesting positive momentum in the crypto space.

4. **Chinese market opportunities** - Multiple China-focused ETFs (FXI, ASHR) show promising technical setups with perfect 100% and 91.3% win rates respectively, potentially indicating a reversal or continuation of strength in Chinese equities.
