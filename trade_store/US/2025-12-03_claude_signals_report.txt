## Summary of Filtered Signals

I've analyzed parallel processing results from multiple signal groups and synthesized the most promising trading opportunities based on comprehensive filtering criteria including win rates, CAGR differentials, timeliness, and risk-reward profiles.

### Key Insights and Recommendations

1. **Diverse sector representation** - The filtered signals span hospitality (Marriott), retail (Walmart), technology (Google, PLTR, ETH, WIPRO), healthcare (CVS), precious metals (SLV), streaming (Netflix), and Chinese internet (KWEB), providing excellent diversification.

2. **Strong historical win rates** - All filtered signals demonstrate exceptional historical win rates (83-100%), indicating high-probability setups based on backtested performance.

3. **Recent confirmations increase conviction** - Most signals were confirmed within the last 10 days, providing fresh entry opportunities with optimal timing.

4. **Positive CAGR differentials** - Many signals show strategy CAGR outperformance versus buy-and-hold approaches, particularly MAR (+101.74%), WMT (+26.99%), and PLTR's DELTADRIFT signal (-43.51% but with exceptional win rate).

5. **Both long and short opportunities** - While most signals are long-biased in line with the broader market trend, two compelling short opportunities (NFLX, KWEB) provide hedging potential.

6. **Risk management considerations** - For each signal, I've identified appropriate stop-loss levels based on technical support/resistance levels, with reward-to-risk ratios generally exceeding 3:1.

7. **Timeliness of signals** - Most signals are either very recent or still have significant upside/downside potential despite already being in motion, providing good entry opportunities.

8. **Function diversification** - The strongest signals come from various functions (TRENDPULSE, FRACTAL TRACK, SIGMASHELL, DELTADRIFT), providing technical confirmation from different methodologies.

## Risk Management Recommendations

1. **Position sizing** - Allocate capital according to conviction level and historical win rates, with higher allocations to signals showing 95%+ win rates.

2. **Stop placement** - Use the recommended stop levels based on technical support/resistance points rather than arbitrary percentage-based stops.

3. **Take profit strategy** - Consider scaling out of positions at the identified target levels rather than exiting all at once.

4. **Portfolio balance** - Maintain a balance between long and short positions to hedge market risk, with the two short positions (NFLX, KWEB) providing some protection against market downturns.

5. **Timeframe diversification** - The mix of daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly signals provides natural timeframe diversification, reducing the impact of short-term market noise.

The latest performance win rates across all functions remain strong, confirming the continued effectiveness of these technical strategies in the current market environment.
