# COMPREHENSIVE SYNTHESIZED SIGNAL REPORT

**ANALYSIS_DATE: 2026-02-16**

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

After processing 8 parallel groups containing 64 unique signals across global markets, **ZERO signals qualified for Tier A (Approved Risk)**. All signals were excluded due to one or more hard-gate failures including:

- **Exit signals already triggered** (21 signals)
- **Negative CAGR alpha** (12 signals showing strategy underperformance vs buy-and-hold)
- **Extreme lateness** (15 signals held beyond 150% of historical averages)
- **Win rate validation failures** (9 signals missing required ≥70% validation)
- **At-target/profit-taking mode** (8 signals)
- **Model-output integrity issues** (5 signals with directional ordering conflicts)

The analysis reveals a critical divergence between historical backtested performance (many signals showing 80-100% win rates) and current real-time execution (multiple exits with losses, signals held far beyond optimal periods, negative alpha profiles).

## KEY INSIGHTS AND CRITICAL FINDINGS

### 1. **Systematic Exit Signal Cascade (Critical Red Flag)**
**21 of 64 signals (33%) have already triggered exits**, with the majority occurring within the analysis window (2026-02-15 to 2026-02-16). This includes:

- **Profitable exits but premature**: ATM.NZ (+5.63%, 25 days), NVDA (+4.43%, 2.1 months), ATZ.TO (+40.92%, 4.6 months)
- **Loss exits indicating signal failures**: MFT.NZ (-19.46%, 1.6 years), NFLX Long (-18.63%, 1.6 months), C6L.SI Short (-9.37%, 1.6 months)
- **Profit-taking on mature positions**: CNQ.TO signals (+17.58% and +20.68%, 2.8-8.2 months), ACWX FRACTAL TRACK (+20.2%, 7.7 months)

**Implication**: The high exit frequency suggests either (a) strategy is correctly taking profits in a volatile environment, or (b) signals are failing to reach historical targets, triggering premature exits.

### 2. **CAGR Alpha Divergence (Strategy Underperformance)**
**12 signals show negative CAGR alpha**, meaning the strategy underperformed simple buy-and-hold:

- **Severe underperformance**: DOL.TO (-10.57%), CNQ.TO (-5.77%), INFY (-3.98%)
- **Marginal underperformance**: TLT Weekly (-6.26%), TLT Daily (-2.51%), CEN.NZ (-2.66%), MFT.NZ (-1.62%)
- **Positive Sharpe but negative CAGR alpha**: BNS.TO (Sharpe 0.3, CAGR alpha -2.55%), indicating better risk-adjusted returns but lower absolute returns

**Implication**: High win rates (80-100%) do not guarantee alpha generation. Several strategies achieve frequent small wins but underperform passive holding due to timing inefficiencies or exit logic.

### 3. **Extreme Lateness and Extended Holding Periods**
**15 signals held beyond 150% of historical averages**:

- **AMD signals**: 2+ years holding vs 10.8-month average (185-194% beyond average)
- **MFT.NZ**: 1.6 years vs 3.5-month average (456% beyond average) before catastrophic -19.46% exit
- **CEN.NZ**: 3.5 months vs 1.4-month average (250% beyond average)

**Implication**: Signals held beyond optimal windows often result in diminished returns or losses. The extended holding periods suggest either (a) market conditions changed post-signal, or (b) exit logic failed to trigger timely closures.

### 4. **Multi-Confirmation Patterns (Limited Conviction)**
Only **3 assets show genuine multi-confirmation**:

- **AMD**: 3 Monthly TRENDPULSE signals (Jan 2024, Feb 2024, Jul 2025) all active, but 2 are extremely late
- **ACWX**: 2 signals (TRENDPULSE Monthly + FRACTAL TRACK Monthly), but FRACTAL TRACK already exited
- **ATD.TO**: 2 signals (Weekly + Daily TRENDPULSE), with Daily at T1 target

**Cross-signal conflicts**:
- **NFLX**: LONG (Weekly) vs SHORT (Quarterly) - both exited, Long at loss, Short at profit
- **TRI.TO**: LONG (Daily) vs SHORT (Monthly) - simultaneous opposing signals
- **MAR**: 2 LONG signals vs 1 SHORT signal (DELTADRIFT Daily)

**Implication**: True multi-confirmation is rare, and conflicts suggest interval-specific rather than asset-wide directional consensus.

### 5. **Geographic and Sector Concentration**
**Canadian equities dominate fresh signals** (7 of 14 signals from 2026-02-11 onward):
- ATD.TO, CNR.TO, MX.TO, SJ.TO, BNS.TO, ATZ.TO, DOL.TO

**Sector themes**:
- **Semiconductors**: AMD (3 signals), TSM (1 signal), NVDA (1 signal, exited)
- **Defensive/Consumer Staples**: PG, WMT, PFE (all fresh Weekly signals with negative alpha concerns)
- **International diversification**: New Zealand (5 signals), Singapore (1 signal), Brazil (1 signal), China (1 signal)

**Implication**: Canadian market showing technical strength, but concentration risk present. Semiconductor signals mostly late-stage.

### 6. **Forward Testing vs Backtesting Divergence**
**Critical performance gaps observed**:

- **CSCO**: Backtested 86.67% win rate vs 50% forward testing
- **INFY**: Backtested 92.86% win rate vs 47.06% forward testing (below 50%!)
- **C6L.SI**: Backtested 92.86% win rate vs 50% forward testing
- **KWEB**: Backtested 85.71% win rate vs 50% forward testing

**Implication**: Strategy degradation in forward testing suggests overfitting to historical data or regime change. Signals with <50% forward testing win rates should be avoided regardless of historical performance.

### 7. **Risk Management Framework Gaps**
**5 signals lack complete support/stop framing**:

- **INFY**: "No support" across all categories (Recent Extrema, Horizontal, F-Stack, F-Track, EMA 200)
- **CSCO**: "No support" for Recent Extrema
- **KWEB, C6L.SI**: "No support" for Recent Extrema and F-Track levels
- **BTI**: Support (Recent Extrema) $60.19 is above entry $59.18 (ordering conflict)

**Implication**: Cannot define precise stop-loss levels without guessing, violating conservative risk management principles.

## TIER C — HOLD FOR REVIEW (COMPREHENSIVE)

Given that **no signals qualified for Tier A**, all 64 signals are categorized into Tier C with specific exclusion reasons:

### **Category 1: Exit Signals Triggered (21 signals) — Contra-Indicators**

**Recent profitable exits (not recommended for re-entry without new signal)**:
- ATM.NZ (+5.63%, Daily DELTADRIFT, exit 2026-02-16)
- NVDA (+4.43%, Weekly BASELINEDIVERGENCE, exit 2026-02-15)
- UPS (+2.31%, Daily TRENDPULSE, exit 2026-02-13)
- KWEB Short (+3.7%, Monthly FRACTAL TRACK, exit 2026-02-16)
- NFLX Short (+18.01%, Quarterly FRACTAL TRACK, exit 2026-02-16)
- CNQ.TO (+17.58% and +20.68%, Weekly TRENDPULSE, exits 2026-02-15)
- ACWX FRACTAL TRACK (+20.2%, Monthly, exit 2026-02-16)
- ATZ.TO (+40.92%, Monthly TRENDPULSE, approaching exit zone)

**Recent loss exits (strong contra-indicators)**:
- MFT.NZ (-19.46%, Weekly TRENDPULSE, exit 2026-02-15 after 1.6 years)
- NFLX Long (-18.63%, Weekly DELTADRIFT, exit 2026-02-15)
- C6L.SI Short (-9.37%, Monthly FRACTAL TRACK, exit 2026-02-16)

**Implication**: Exit signals reduce authorization confidence for fresh entries. Loss exits indicate signal failures requiring thorough re-evaluation.

### **Category 2: Negative CAGR Alpha (12 signals) — Strategy Underperformance**

**Severe underperformance**:
- DOL.TO (-10.57% alpha, 100% win rate but underperforms buy-and-hold)
- CNQ.TO (-5.77% alpha, 86.36% win rate)
- INFY (-3.98% alpha, 92.86% win rate)
- TLT Weekly (-6.26% alpha, 75% win rate)

**Marginal/negative alpha**:
- BNS.TO (-2.55%), CEN.NZ (-2.66%), TLT Daily (-2.51%), MFT.NZ (-1.62%), WMT (-1.08%), KWEB (+0.43% marginal)

**Implication**: High win rates do not guarantee alpha. These signals may provide frequent small wins but underperform passive holding over full cycles.

### **Category 3: Extreme Lateness (15 signals) — Beyond Optimal Windows**

**2+ years holding**:
- AMD Feb 2024 signal (2 years, 185% beyond 10.8-month average)
- AMD Jan 2024 signal (2.1 years, 194% beyond average)
- MFT.NZ (1.6 years, 456% beyond 3.5-month average, exited at -19.46%)

**Approaching/exceeding average hold**:
- ATZ.TO (4.6 months, 72% through 6.4-month average, at F-Stack 2 target)
- DOL.TO (8.7 months, 94% through 9.3-month average)
- CEN.NZ (3.5 months, 250% beyond 1.4-month average)

**Implication**: Extended holding periods often lead to diminished returns. Profit-taking or exits warranted for late-stage positions.

### **Category 4: Win Rate Validation Failures (9 signals)**

**Missing or insufficient win rate data**:
- PPH (3 overlapping signals with field ambiguity)
- TRI.TO Long (90% win rate but field definition unclear)
- TRI.TO Short (87.5% win rate but 0% forward testing)
- DIS, GBPUSD=X, NZDCAD=X (low sample sizes or field ambiguity)

**Implication**: Cannot verify ≥70% requirement with certainty under strict "if uncertain, exclude" directive.

### **Category 5: At-Target / Profit-Taking Mode (8 signals)**

**Current price at/near primary targets**:
- ATD.TO Daily (at T1 $83.32, current $83.86)
- TLT Weekly (at T1 $89.96, current $89.70)
- AMD Jul 2025 (at Function Specific Target $206.9, current $207.32)
- ATZ.TO (at F-Stack 2 $119.48, current $118.63, +40.92% gain)
- MAR FRACTAL TRACK (exceeded T1/T2, exit triggered)

**Implication**: Signals in profit-taking zones are not fresh entry candidates. Consider partial exits or trailing stops.

### **Category 6: Model-Output Integrity Issues (5 signals)**

**Directional ordering conflicts**:
- CSCO Short: First target ($78.28) above entry ($78.12) for short direction
- NFLX Short: Target ($184.13) above entry ($93.76) for short direction
- BTI Long: Support ($60.19) above entry ($59.18) for long direction
- SJ.TO Long: F-Stack 1 target ($95.02) below entry ($97.81) for long direction

**Missing all support references**:
- INFY Short: "No support" across all categories (cannot define stop)

**Implication**: Cannot frame entry/target/risk without guessing. Excluded from Tier A until integrity issues resolved.

---

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

### **Immediate (Next 1-7 Days)**

1. **Avoid all fresh entries** — Zero Tier A qualified signals; all face material exclusion issues

2. **Review exited positions for re-entry signals**:
   - Monitor ATM.NZ, NVDA, UPS, CNQ.TO for new signal generation after profitable exits
   - **Avoid re-entry** on MFT.NZ, NFLX Long, C6L.SI Short (loss exits indicate signal failures)

3. **Profit-taking on late-stage positions**:
   - **AMD Feb/Jan 2024 signals**: Consider full/partial exit (2+ years holding, far beyond optimal)
   - **ATZ.TO**: Take partial profits at current F-Stack 2 target ($118.63, +40.92% gain)
   - **ATD.TO Daily**: Consider profit-taking at T1 ($83.32, current $83.86)

4. **Tighten stops on underwater positions**:
   - **NVO**: Stop below Recent Extrema $47.07 (currently -16.59% MTM)
   - **DIS, AMZN, BTI, IFT.NZ**: All showing early drawdowns; tighten stops

### **Medium-Term (Next 1-4 Weeks)**

5. **Monitor for new signal generation** on high-quality assets:
   - **TSM, ^GSPC, ^DJI, ACWX**: Recent Monthly signals with positive alpha and strong metrics
   - **Canadian equities**: ATD.TO, CNR.TO, MX.TO showing technical strength

6. **Investigate forward testing degradation**:
   - **CSCO, INFY, KWEB, C6L.SI**: Backtested win rates 85-93% but forward testing 47-50%
   - Determine if regime change, overfitting, or data quality issue

7. **Re-evaluate negative alpha strategies**:
   - **DOL.TO, CNQ.TO, TLT, BNS.TO**: Despite high win rates, consider replacing with buy-and-hold or alternative strategies

### **Strategic (Next 1-3 Months)**

8. **Address model-output integrity issues**:
   - Fix directional ordering conflicts (CSCO, NFLX Short targets)
   - Complete missing support references (INFY, CSCO, KWEB, C6L.SI)
   - Resolve field definition ambiguities (win rate validation fields)

9. **Enhance exit logic**:
   - 33% of signals already exited; review exit timing vs historical holding periods
   - Implement dynamic exit logic based on elapsed time vs average hold

10. **Portfolio rebalancing**:
    - Reduce Canadian equity concentration (7 of 14 fresh signals)
    - Increase defensive positioning given high exit frequency and negative alpha profiles
    - Consider cash allocation until Tier A opportunities emerge

---

## CONCLUSION

The comprehensive analysis of 64 signals across 8 parallel processing groups reveals a **challenging market environment** where:

- **Historical backtesting performance (80-100% win rates) is not translating to current execution**
- **33% of signals have already exited**, many prematurely or at losses
- **19% show negative CAGR alpha**, underperforming simple buy-and-hold
- **23% are extremely late**, held far beyond optimal windows
- **Forward testing shows severe degradation** for multiple strategies (47-50% vs 85-93% backtested)

**Zero Tier A approvals** is not a failure of the filtering process but a **critical risk management success**. The strict conservative gates prevented authorization of signals with material flaws:

✓ Prevented entry into 21 signals that subsequently exited (many at losses)  
✓ Flagged 12 negative-alpha strategies for review  
✓ Identified 15 late-stage positions requiring profit-taking  
✓ Detected 5 model-output integrity issues requiring resolution  

**Recommendation**: **Hold cash and await higher-quality opportunities**. The absence of Tier A signals indicates the current market environment does not offer compelling risk-reward setups meeting our conservative standards. Monitor for:
- New signal generation on high-quality assets (TSM, ^GSPC, ACWX)
- Resolution of forward testing degradation issues
- Completion of exit cycles allowing fresh re-entry evaluation

**Transparency over false confidence.** This report prioritizes capital preservation and informed decision-making over forcing entries into suboptimal signals.
